'''Symmetry''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] συμμετρία ''symmetria'' "agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement")<ref>{{cite web |title=symmetry |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=symmetry |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref> in everyday language refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance.<ref>{{cite book |last = Zee |first = A. |title = Fearful Symmetry |publisher = Princeton University Press |location = Princeton, N.J. |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-691-13482-6}}</ref>{{efn|For example, [[Aristotle]] ascribed spherical shape to the heavenly bodies, attributing this formally defined geometric measure of symmetry to the natural order and perfection of the cosmos.}} In mathematics, "symmetry" has a more precise definition, that an object is invariant to a transformation, such as reflection but including other transforms too.  Although these two meanings of "symmetry" can sometimes be told apart, they are related, so they are here discussed together.

Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of [[time]]; as a [[space|spatial relationship]]; through [[geometric transformation]]s such as [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of [[abstract object]]s, [[scientific model|theoretic models]], [[language]], [[music]] and even [[knowledge]] itself.<ref name="Mainzer000">{{cite book |title = Symmetry And Complexity: The Spirit and Beauty of Nonlinear Science |first = Klaus |last = Mainzer |publisher = World Scientific |year = 2005 |isbn = 981-256-192-7}}</ref>{{efn|Symmetric objects can be material, such as a person, [[crystal]], [[quilt]], [[Pamment|floor tiles]], or [[molecule]], or it can be an [[abstract object|abstract]] structure such as a [[mathematical equation]] or a series of tones ([[music]]).}}

This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in [[mathematics]], including [[geometry]], the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in [[science]] and [[nature]]; and in the arts, covering [[architecture]], [[art]] and [[music]].

The opposite of symmetry is [[asymmetry]].

[[File:The armoured triskelion on the flag of the Isle of Man.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The [[triskelion]] has 3-fold rotational symmetry.]]

A geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion.<ref> E. H. Lockwood, R. H. Macmillan, ''Geometric Symmetry'', London: Cambridge Press,
1978</ref> This means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation that moves individual pieces of the object but doesn't change the overall shape. The type of symmetry is determined by the way the pieces are organized, or by the type of transformation:

* An object has [[reflectional symmetry]] if there is a line of symmetry going through it which divides it into two pieces which are mirror images of each other.<ref>{{cite book |title=Symmetry |last=Weyl |first=Hermann |authorlink=Hermann Weyl |year=1982 |origyear=1952 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton | isbn=0-691-02374-3 |pages= |url= |ref=Weyl 1982}}</ref> 
*An object has [[rotational symmetry]] if the object can be rotated about a fixed point without changing the overall shape.<ref>{{cite book | author=Singer, David A. | year=1998 | title=Geometry: Plane and Fancy | publisher=Springer Science & Business Media}}</ref>
*An object has [[translational symmetry]] if it can be [[translation (geometry)|translated]] without changing its overall shape.<ref>Stenger, Victor J. (2000) and Mahou Shiro (2007). ''Timeless Reality''. Prometheus Books. Especially chapter 12. Nontechnical.</ref>
*An object has [[helical symmetry]] if it can be simultaneously translated and rotated in three-dimensional space along a line known as a [[screw axis]].<ref>Bottema, O, and B. Roth, ''Theoretical Kinematics,'' Dover Publications (September 1990)</ref>
*An object has [[scale symmetry]] if it does not change shape when it is expanded or contracted.<ref>Tian Yu Cao ''Conceptual Foundations of Quantum Field Theory'' Cambridge University Press p.154-155</ref> [[Fractals]] also exhibit a form of scale symmetry, where small portions of the fractal are similar in shape to large portions.<ref name="Gouyet">{{cite book | last = Gouyet | first = Jean-François | title = Physics and fractal structures | publisher = Masson Springer | location = Paris/New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-387-94153-0 }}</ref>
*Other symmetries include [[glide reflection]] symmetry and [[improper rotation|rotoreflection]] symmetry.

===In logic===

A [[binary relation|dyadic relation]] ''R'' is symmetric if and only if, whenever it's true that ''Rab'', it's true that ''Rba''.<ref>Josiah Royce, Ignas K. Skrupskelis (2005) ''The Basic Writings of Josiah Royce: Logic, loyalty, and community (Google eBook)'' Fordham Univ Press, p. 790</ref> Thus, "is the same age as" is symmetrical, for if Paul is the same age as Mary, then Mary is the same age as Paul.

Symmetric binary [[logical connective]]s are ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' (∧, or &), ''[[logical disjunction|or]]'' (∨, or |), ''[[logical biconditional|biconditional]]'' ([[if and only if]]) (↔), ''[[logical nand|nand]]'' (not-and, or ⊼), ''[[xor]]'' (not-biconditional, or ⊻), and ''[[logical nor|nor]]'' (not-or, or ⊽).
===Other areas of mathematics===
{{main|Symmetry (mathematics)}}
Generalizing from geometrical symmetry in the previous section, we say that a [[mathematical object]] is ''symmetric'' with respect to a given [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operation]], if, when applied to the object, this operation preserves some property of the object.<ref>Christopher G. Morris
 (1992) ''Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology'' Gulf Professional Publishing</ref> The set of operations that preserve a given property of the object form a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

In general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry. Examples include [[even and odd functions]] in [[calculus]]; the [[symmetric group]] in [[abstract algebra]]; [[symmetric matrix|symmetric matrices]] in [[linear algebra]]; and the [[Galois group]] in [[Galois theory]].

===In physics===
{{Main|Symmetry in physics}}

Symmetry in physics has been generalized to mean [[Invariant (physics)|invariance]]—that is, lack of change—under any kind of transformation, for example [[General covariance|arbitrary coordinate transformations]].<ref>{{cite book |title = Symmetries and Group Theory in Particle Physics: An Introduction to Space-Time and Internal Symmetries |first1 = Giovanni |last1 = Costa |first2=Gianluigi |last2=Fogli| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media |year = 2012 |pages = 112}}</ref> This concept has become one of the most powerful tools of theoretical physics, as it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. In fact, this role inspired the Nobel laureate [[Philip Warren Anderson|PW Anderson]] to write in his widely read 1972 article ''More is Different'' that "it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry."<ref>{{cite journal | last=Anderson | first=P.W. | title=More is Different | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=177 | issue=4047| pages=393–396 | year=1972 | url=http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf | doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393 | pmid=17796623 | format=|bibcode = 1972Sci...177..393A }}</ref> See [[Noether's theorem]] (which, in greatly simplified form, states that for every continuous mathematical symmetry, there is a corresponding conserved quantity; a conserved current, in Noether's original language);<ref name=Noether>{{Cite book | last = Kosmann-Schwarzbach | first = Yvette | authorlink = Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach | title = The Noether theorems: Invariance and conservation laws in the twentieth century | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] | series = Sources and Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-387-87867-6}}</ref> and also, [[Wigner's classification]], which says that the symmetries of the laws of physics determine the properties of the particles found in nature.<ref>{{citation|first=E.

[[Bilateria|Bilateral animals]], including humans, are more or less symmetric with respect to the [[sagittal plane]] which divides the body into left and right halves.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=James W. |title=Bilateria |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d802620 |publisher=AccessScience |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> Animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right.

Plants and sessile (attached) animals such as [[sea anemone]]s often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], which suits them because food or threats may arrive from any direction. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].<ref>{{cite book | title=What Shape is a Snowflake? Magical Numbers in Nature | publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson | author=Stewart, Ian | year=2001 | pages=64–65}}</ref>

===In chemistry===
{{Main|molecular symmetry}}

Symmetry is important to [[chemistry]] because it undergirds essentially all ''specific'' interactions between molecules in nature (i.e.,  via the interaction of natural and human-made [[chiral (chemistry)|chiral]] molecules with inherently chiral biological systems). The control of the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of molecules produced in modern [[chemical synthesis]] contributes to the ability of scientists to offer [[drug|therapeutic]] interventions with minimal [[side effects]]. A rigorous understanding of symmetry explains fundamental observations in [[quantum chemistry]], and in the applied areas of  [[spectroscopy]] and [[crystallography]]. The theory and application of symmetry to these areas of [[physical science]] draws heavily on the mathematical area of [[group theory]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Lowe, John P; Peterson, Kirk | title=Quantum Chemistry | publisher=Academic Press| edition=Third | year=2005 | isbn=0-12-457551-X}}</ref>

==In social interactions==
People observe the symmetrical nature, often including asymmetrical balance, of social interactions in a variety of contexts. These include assessments of reciprocity, empathy, apology, dialog, respect, justice, and revenge. Symmetrical interactions send the message "we are all the same" while asymmetrical interactions send the message "I am special; better than you." Peer relationships are based on symmetry, power relationships are based on asymmetry.<ref>[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/symmetry.htm Emotional Competency] Entry describing Symmetry</ref>

[[File:Taj Mahal, Agra views from around (85).JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|The Taj Mahal has bilateral symmetry.]]

Symmetry finds its ways into architecture at every scale, from the overall external views of buildings such as Gothic [[cathedral]]s and [[The White House]], through the layout of the individual [[floor plan]]s, and down to the design of individual building elements such as [[mosaic|tile mosaics]]. [[Islam]]ic buildings such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and the [[Lotfollah mosque]] make elaborate use of symmetry both in their structure and in their ornamentation.<ref>[http://members.tripod.com/vismath/kim/ Williams: Symmetry in Architecture].

===In pottery and metal vessels===
[[File:Makingpottery.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Clay pots thrown on a [[pottery wheel]] acquire rotational symmetry.]]

Since the earliest uses of [[pottery wheel]]s to help shape clay vessels, pottery has had a strong relationship to symmetry. Pottery created using a wheel acquires full rotational symmetry in its cross-section, while allowing substantial freedom of shape in the vertical direction. Upon this inherently symmetrical starting point, potters from ancient times onwards have added patterns that modify the rotational symmetry to achieve visual objectives.

Cast metal vessels lacked the inherent rotational symmetry of wheel-made pottery, but otherwise provided a similar opportunity to decorate their surfaces with patterns pleasing to those who used them. The ancient [[Chinese people|Chinese]], for example, used symmetrical patterns in their bronze castings as early as the 17th century BC. Bronze vessels exhibited both a bilateral main motif and a repetitive translated border design.<ref>[http://www.chinavoc.com/arts/handicraft/bronze.htm The Art of Chinese Bronzes].

===In  quilts===
[[File:kitchen kaleid.svg|thumb|120px|left|Kitchen Kaleidoscope Block]]

As [[quilt]]s are made from square blocks (usually 9, 16, or 25 pieces to a block) with each smaller piece usually consisting of fabric triangles, the craft lends itself readily to the application of symmetry.<ref>[http://its.guilford.k12.nc.us/webquests/quilts/quilts.htm Quate: Exploring Geometry Through Quilts].

[[File:Farsh1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Persian rug.]]

A long tradition of the use of symmetry in [[carpet]] and rug patterns spans a variety of cultures. American [[Navajo people|Navajo]] Indians used bold diagonals and rectangular motifs. Many [[Oriental rugs]] have intricate reflected centers and borders that translate a pattern. Not surprisingly, rectangular rugs typically use quadrilateral symmetry—that is, [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] that are reflected across both the horizontal and vertical axes.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010203155200/http://marlamallett.com/default.htm Marla Mallett Textiles & Tribal Oriental Rugs].

Symmetry is not restricted to the visual arts. Its role in the history of [[music]] touches many aspects of the creation and perception of music.

====Musical form====

Symmetry has been used as a [[musical form|formal]] constraint by many composers, such as the [[arch form|arch (swell) form]] (ABCBA) used by [[Steve Reich]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[James Tenney]]. In classical music, Bach used the symmetry concepts of permutation and invariance.<ref>see ("Fugue No. 21," [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii21s.pdf pdf] or [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii21.html Shockwave])</ref>

====Pitch structures====
Symmetry is also an important consideration in the formation of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]], traditional or [[tonality|tonal]] music being made up of non-symmetrical groups of [[pitch (music)|pitches]], such as the [[diatonic scale]] or the [[major chord]]. [[Symmetrical scale]]s or chords, such as the [[whole tone scale]], [[augmented chord]], or diminished [[seventh chord]] (diminished-diminished seventh), are said to lack direction or a sense of forward motion, are [[ambiguous]] as to the [[Key (music)|key]] or tonal center, and have a less specific [[diatonic functionality]]. However, composers such as [[Alban Berg]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[George Perle]] have used axes of symmetry and/or [[interval cycle]]s in an analogous way to [[musical key|keys]] or non-[[tonality|tonal]] tonal [[Tonic (music)|center]]s.

{{harvtxt|Perle|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Symmetry, the twelve-tone scale, and tonality |first=George |last=Perle |authorlink=George Perle |journal=Contemporary Music Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=1992 |pages=81–96 |doi=10.1080/07494469200640151}}</ref> explains "C–E, D–F♯, [and] Eb–G, are different instances of the same [[interval (music)|interval]] … the other kind of identity. … has to do with axes of symmetry. C–E belongs to a family of symmetrically related dyads as follows:"

{|
|-
|D
| 
|D♯
| 
|'''E'''
| 
|F

|-
|D
| 
|C♯
| 
|'''C'''
| 
|B
| 
|A♯
| 
|A
| 
|G♯
|}

Thus in addition to being part of the interval-4 family, C–E is also a part of the sum-4 family (with C equal to 0).

Interval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven pitch segment of C5 (the cycle of fifths, which are [[enharmonic]] with the cycle of fourths) will produce the diatonic major scale. Cyclic tonal [[chord progression|progressions]] in the works of [[Romantic music|Romantic]] composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Wagner]] form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the atonal music of Modernists such as Bartók, [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Edgard Varèse]], and the Vienna school. At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality.

The first extended composition consistently based on symmetrical pitch relations was probably Alban Berg's ''Quartet'', Op. 3 (1910).<ref>{{cite book | title=The Listening Composer | publisher=University of California Press | author=Perle, George | year=1990}}</ref>

====Equivalency====

[[Tone row]]s or [[pitch class]] [[Set theory (music)|sets]] which are [[Invariant (music)|invariant]] under [[Permutation (music)|retrograde]] are horizontally symmetrical, under [[inversion (music)|inversion]] vertically. See also [[Asymmetric rhythm]].

===In other arts and crafts===
[[File:Celticknotwork.png|frame|[[Celtic knot]]work]]

Symmetries appear in the design of objects of all kinds. Examples include [[beadwork]], [[furniture]], [[sand painting]]s, [[knot]]work, [[masks]], and [[musical instruments]]. Symmetries are central to the art of [[M.C. Escher]] and the many applications of [[tessellation|tiling]].

===In aesthetics===
