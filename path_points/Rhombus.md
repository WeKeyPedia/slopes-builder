In [[Euclidean geometry]], a '''rhombus''' (◊), plural '''rhombi''' or '''rhombuses''', is a [[simple polygon|simple]] (non-self-intersecting) [[quadrilateral]] all of whose four sides have the same length. Another name is '''equilateral quadrilateral''', since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a '''diamond''', after the [[Diamonds (suit)|diamonds]] suit in playing cards, or a '''[[lozenge]]''', though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60° angle (see [[Polyiamond]]), and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45° angle.

Every rhombus is a [[parallelogram]], and a rhombus with right angles is a [[Square (geometry)|square]].<ref>Note: [[Euclid]]'s original definition and some English dictionaries' definition of rhombus excludes squares, but modern mathematicians prefer the inclusive definition.</ref><ref>{{MathWorld |urlname=Square |title=Square}} inclusive usage</ref>

==Etymology==
The word "rhombus" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ῥόμβος}}(''rhombos''), meaning something that spins,<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dr%28o%2Fmbos {{lang|el|ῥόμβος}}], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> which derives from the verb ρέμβω (''rhembō''), meaning "to turn round and round".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dr%28e%2Fmbw ρέμβω], Henry George  Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> The word was used both by [[Euclid]] and  [[Archimedes]], who used the term "solid rhombus" for two right circular [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s sharing a common base.<ref>[http://www.pballew.net/rhomb The Origin of Rhombus]</ref>

==Characterizations==
A [[simple polygon|simple]] (non self-intersecting) quadrilateral is a rhombus [[if and only if]] it is any one of the following:<ref>Zalman Usiskin and Jennifer Griffin, "The Classification of Quadrilaterals. A Study of Definition", Information Age Publishing, 2008, pp. 55-56.</ref><ref>Owen Byer, Felix Lazebnik and Deirdre Smeltzer, ''Methods for Euclidean Geometry'', Mathematical Association of America, 2010, p. 53.</ref>
*a quadrilateral with four sides of equal length (by definition)
*a quadrilateral in which the [[diagonal]]s are [[perpendicular]] and [[Bisection|bisect]] each other
*a quadrilateral in which each diagonal bisects two opposite [[Internal and external angle|interior angles]]
*a parallelogram in which a diagonal bisects an interior angle
*a [[parallelogram]] in which at least two consecutive sides are equal in length
*a parallelogram in which the diagonals are perpendicular (an [[orthodiagonal]] parallelogram)

==Basic properties==
Every rhombus has two [[diagonal]]s connecting pairs of opposite vertices, and two pairs of parallel sides. Using [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[triangle]]s, one can [[mathematical proof|prove]] that the rhombus is [[symmetry|symmetric]] across each of these diagonals. It follows that any rhombus has the following properties:
* Opposite [[angle]]s of a rhombus have equal measure
* The two diagonals of a rhombus are [[perpendicular]]; that is, a rhombus is an [[orthodiagonal quadrilateral]]
* Its diagonals bisect opposite angles

The first property implies that every rhombus is a [[parallelogram]]. A rhombus therefore has all of the [[Parallelogram#Properties|properties of a parallelogram]]: for example, opposite sides are parallel; adjacent angles are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]]; the two diagonals [[bisection|bisect]] one another; any line through the midpoint bisects the area; and the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals (the [[parallelogram law]]). Thus denoting the common side as ''a'' and the diagonals as ''p'' and ''q'', in every rhombus
:<math>\displaystyle 4a^2=p^2+q^2.</math>

Not every parallelogram is a rhombus, though any parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals (the second property) is a rhombus. In general, any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, one of which is a line of symmetry, is a [[kite (geometry)|kite]]. Every rhombus is a kite, and any quadrilateral that is both a kite and parallelogram is a rhombus.

A rhombus is a [[tangential quadrilateral]].<ref name=Mathworld>{{mathworld |urlname=Rhombus |title=Rhombus}}</ref> That is, it has an [[inscribed figure|inscribed circle]] that is tangent to all four sides.

==Area==
[[File:Rhombus1.svg|thumb|280px|The height ''h'' is the perpendicular distance between any two non-adjacent sides, or the diameter of the circle inscribed.]]

As for all parallelograms, the [[area]] ''A'' of a rhombus is the product of its base and its height (''h''). The base is simply any side length ''a'':
:<math>A = a \cdot h .</math>

The area can also be expressed as the base squared times the sine of any angle:
:<math>A = a^2 \cdot \sin \alpha = a^2 \cdot \sin \beta ,</math>

or as half the product of the diagonals ''p'', ''q'':
:<math>A = \frac{p \cdot q}{2} ,</math>

or as  the [[semiperimeter]] times the radius of the circle [[Inscribed figure|inscribed]] in the rhombus (inradius):
:<math>A = 2a \cdot r .</math>

Another way, in common with parallelograms, is to consider two adjacent sides as vectors, forming a [[bivector]], so the area is the magnitude of the bivector (the magnitude of the vector product of the two vectors), which is the [[determinant]] of the two vectors' Cartesian coordinates: area = x1 × y2 - x2 × y1.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XghF70fqkY WildLinAlg episode 4], Norman J Wildberger, Univ. of New South Wales, 2010, lecture via youtube</ref>

==Inradius==
The inradius (the radius of the incircle), denoted by r, can be expressed in terms of the diagonals ''p'' and ''q'' as<ref name=Mathworld/>
:<math>r = \frac{p \cdot q}{2\sqrt{p^2+q^2}}.</math>

==Dual properties==
The [[dual polygon]] of a ''rhombus'' is a [[rectangle]]:<ref>de Villiers, Michael, "Equiangular cyclic and equilateral circumscribed polygons", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 95, March 2011, 102-107.</ref>
*A rhombus has all sides equal, while a rectangle has all angles equal.
*A rhombus has opposite angles equal, while a rectangle has opposite sides equal.
*A rhombus has an inscribed circle, while a rectangle has a [[circumcircle]].
*A rhombus has an axis of symmetry through each pair of opposite vertex angles, while a rectangle has an axis of symmetry through each pair of opposite sides.
*The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at equal angles, while the diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length.
*The figure formed by joining, in order, the midpoints of the sides of a rhombus is a [[rectangle]] and vice-versa.

==Other properties==
*One of the five 2D [[lattice (group)|lattice]] types is the rhombic lattice, also called [[centered rectangular lattice]]
* Identical rhombi can tile the 2D plane in three different ways, including, for the 60° rhombus, the [[rhombille tiling]]

==As the faces of a polyhedron==

A [[rhombohedron]] is a three-dimensional figure like a [[cube]], except that its six faces are rhombi instead of squares.

The [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is a [[convex polyhedron]] with 12 [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] rhombi as its [[face (geometry)|faces]].

The [[rhombic triacontahedron]] is a [[convex polyhedron]] with 30 [[golden rhombus|golden rhombi]] (rhombi whose diagonals are in the [[golden ratio]]) as its faces.

The [[great rhombic triacontahedron]] is a nonconvex [[Isohedral figure|isohedral]], [[isotoxal]] [[polyhedron]] with 30 intersecting rhombic faces.

The [[rhombic hexecontahedron]] is a [[stellation]] of the rhombic triacontahedron. It is nonconvex with 60 [[golden rhombus|golden rhombic]] faces with [[icosahedral symmetry]].

The [[rhombic enneacontahedron]] is a polyhedron composed of 90 rhombic faces, with three, five, or six rhombi meeting at each vertex. It has 60 broad rhombi and 30 slim ones.

The [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron]] is a convex polyhedron with 6 rhombic and 6 [[trapezoid]]al faces.

The [[rhombic icosahedron]] is a polyhedron composed of 20 rhombic faces, of which three, four, or five meet at each vertex. It has 10 faces on the polar axis with 10 faces following the equator.
