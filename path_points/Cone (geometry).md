[[File:Cone 3d.png|thumb|250px|right|A right circular cone and an oblique circular cone]]
A '''cone''' is a three-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[geometric shape]] that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] or vertex.

More precisely, it is the solid figure bounded by a base in a plane and by a surface (called the lateral surface) formed by the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all straight line segments joining the apex to the [[perimeter]] of the base. The term "cone" sometimes refers just to the surface of this solid figure, or just to the lateral surface.

The axis of a cone is the straight line (if any), passing through the apex, about which the base (and the whole cone) has a [[rotational symmetry]]. 

In common usage in elementary [[geometry]], cones are assumed to be '''right circular''', where ''circular'' means that the base is a [[circle]] and ''right'' means that the axis passes through the centre of the base [[perpendicular|at right angles]] to its plane. Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones, in which the axis does not pass perpendicularly through the centre of the base.<ref name="MathWorld">{{MathWorld |urlname=Cone |title=Cone}}</ref> In general, however, the base may be any shape and the apex may lie anywhere (though it is usually assumed that the base is bounded and therefore has finite [[area (geometry)|area]], and that the apex lies outside the plane of the base).

A cone with a [[polygon]]al base is called a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]].<ref>[http://www.andrews.edu/~calkins/math/webtexts/geom09.htm ''A Review of Basic Geometry'']</ref>

== Other mathematical meanings ==
[[File:DoubleCone.png|thumb|right|A double cone (not shown infinitely extended)]]
In mathematical usage, the word "cone" is used also for an "infinite cone", the union of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[half-line]]s that start at a common apex point and go through a base. An infinite cone is not bounded by its base but extends to infinity.  A "doubly infinite cone", or "double cone", is the union of a set of [[straight line]]s that pass through a common apex point and go through a base, therefore double infinite cones extend symmetrically on both sides of the apex. 

The boundary of an infinite or doubly infinite cone is a [[conical surface]], and the intersection of a plane with this surface is a [[conic section]]. For infinite cones, the word ''axis'' again usually refers to the axis of rotational symmetry (if any). Either half of a double cone on one side of the apex is called a "nappe". 

Depending on the context, "cone" may also mean specifically a [[convex cone]] or a [[projective cone]].

== Further terminology ==
The perimeter of the base of a cone is called the "directrix", and each of the line segments between the directrix and apex is a "generatrix" of the lateral surface.  (For the connection between this sense of the term "directrix" and the [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]] of a conic section, see [[Dandelin spheres]].)
  
The volume and the surface area for a straight cone are described in the [[#Geometry|geometry]] section below.

The "base radius" of a circular cone is the [[radius]] of its base; often this is simply called the radius of the cone. The [[aperture]] of a right circular cone is the maximum angle between two generatrix lines; if the generatrix makes an angle ''θ'' to the axis, the aperture is 2''θ''.

A cone with its apex cut off by a plane is called a "truncated cone"; if the truncation plane is parallel to the cone's base, it is called a [[frustum]].  An "elliptical cone" is a cone with an [[ellipse|elliptical]] base.  A "generalized cone" is the surface created by the set of lines passing through a vertex and every point on a boundary (also see [[visual hull]]).

== Geometry ==
<!-- The formulae are correct. Please check your work before editing. --><!-- Please put proofs and derivations in [[cone (geometry) proofs]] -->

===Surface area===
The [[lateral surface]] area of a right circular cone is <math>LSA = \pi r l</math> where <math>r</math> is the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cone and <math>l</math> is the lateral height of the cone (given by the [[Pythagorean theorem]] <math>l=\sqrt{r^2+h^2}</math> where <math>h</math> is the height of the cone).  The surface area of the bottom circle of a cone is the same as for any circle, <math>\pi r^2</math>.  Thus the total surface area of a right circular cone is:

:<math>SA=\pi r^2+\pi r l</math> or
:<math>SA=\pi r(r+l)</math>

=== Volume ===
The [[volume]] <math>V</math> of any conic solid is one third of the product of the area of the base <math>A_B</math> and the height <math>H</math> 
:<math>V = \frac{1}{3}A_B H</math>

In modern mathematics, this formula can easily be computed using calculus – it is, up to scaling, the integral <math>\int x^2 dx = \tfrac{1}{3} x^3.</math> Without using calculus, the formula can be proven by comparing the cone to a pyramid and applying [[Cavalieri's principle]] – specifically, comparing the cone to a (vertically scaled) right square pyramid, which forms one third of a cube. This formula cannot be proven without using such infinitesimal arguments – unlike the 2-dimensional formulae for polyhedral area, though similar to the area of the circle – and hence admitted less rigorous proofs before the advent of calculus, with the ancient Greeks using the [[method of exhaustion]]. This is essentially the content of [[Hilbert's third problem]] – more precisely, not all polyhedral pyramids are ''scissors congruent'' (can be cut apart into finite pieces and rearranged into the other), and thus volume cannot be computed purely by using a decomposition argument.

=== Center of mass ===
The [[center of mass]] of a conic solid of uniform density lies one-quarter of the way from the center of the base to the vertex, on the straight line joining the two.

=== Right circular cone ===
For a circular cone with radius ''R'' and height ''H'', the formula for volume becomes

:<math> V = \int_0^H r^2 \pi \, dh </math>

where ''r'' is the radius of the cone at height ''h'' measured from the apex:

:<math> r= R \frac{h}{H} </math>

Thus:

:<math> V = \int_0^H \left[R \frac{h}{H}\right]^2 \pi \, dh </math>

Thus:

:<math>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi R^2 H. </math>

For a right circular cone, the surface [[area]] <math>A</math> is 
:<math>A =\pi R^2 + \pi R S\,</math> &nbsp; where &nbsp; <math>S = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2}</math> &nbsp; is the [[slant height]].
The first term in the area formula, <math>\pi R^2</math>, is the area of the base, while the second term, <math>\pi R S</math>, is the area of the lateral surface.

A right circular cone with height <math>h</math> and aperture  <math>2\theta</math>, whose axis is the <math>z</math> coordinate axis and whose apex is the origin, is described parametrically as
:<math>F(s,t,u) = \left(u \tan s \cos t, u \tan s \sin t, u \right)</math>
where <math>s,t,u</math> range over <math>[0,\theta)</math>, <math>[0,2\pi)</math>, and <math>[0,h]</math>, respectively.

In [[Implicit function|implicit]] form, the same solid is defined by the inequalities
:<math>\{ F(x,y,z) \leq 0, z\geq 0, z\leq h\},</math>
where
:<math>F(x,y,z) = (x^2 + y^2)(\cos\theta)^2 - z^2 (\sin \theta)^2.\,</math>

More generally, a right circular cone with vertex at the origin, axis parallel to the vector <math>d</math>, and aperture <math>2\theta</math>, is given by the implicit [[vector calculus|vector]] equation <math>F(u) = 0</math> where
:<math>F(u) = (u \cdot d)^2 - (d \cdot d) (u \cdot u) (\cos \theta)^2</math> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <math>F(u) = u \cdot d - |d| |u| \cos \theta</math>
where <math>u=(x,y,z)</math>, and <math>u \cdot d</math> denotes the [[dot product]].

== Projective geometry ==
[[File:Australia Square building in George Street Sydney.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|In [[projective geometry]], a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity, which corresponds visually to a cylinder in perspective appearing to be a cone towards the sky.]]
In [[projective geometry]], a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity. Intuitively, if one keeps the base fixed and takes the limit as the apex goes to infinity, one obtains a cylinder, the angle of the side increasing as [[arctan]], in the limit forming a [[right angle]].

This is useful in the definition of [[degenerate conic]]s, which require considering the [[cylindrical conic]]s.
