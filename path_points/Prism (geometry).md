In [[geometry]], a '''prism''' is a [[polyhedron]] with an ''n''-sided [[polygon]]al [[base (geometry)|base]], another [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] base (with the same [[rotation (geometry)|rotational orientation]]), and ''n'' other [[face (geometry)|faces]] (necessarily all [[parallelogram]]s) joining [[corresponding sides]] of the two bases. All [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] parallel to the base faces are congruent to the bases. Prisms are named for their base, so a prism with a [[pentagonal]] base is called a pentagonal prism. The prisms are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s.

==General, right and uniform prisms==
A ''right prism'' is a prism in which the joining edges and faces are [[perpendicular]] to the base faces. This applies if the joining faces are [[rectangular]]. If the joining edges and faces are not perpendicular to the base faces, it is called an ''oblique prism''.

Some texts may apply the term ''rectangular prism'' or ''square prism'' to both a right rectangular-sided prism and a right square-sided prism.
The term ''uniform prism'' can be used for a right prism with square sides, since such prisms are in the set of [[uniform polyhedra]].

An ''n''-prism, having [[regular polygon]] ends and [[rectangular]] sides, approaches a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] solid as ''n'' approaches [[infinity]].

Right prisms with regular bases and equal edge lengths form one of the two infinite series of [[semiregular polyhedra]], the other series being the [[antiprism]]s. 

The [[dual polyhedron|dual]] of a right prism is a [[bipyramid]].

A [[parallelepiped]] is a prism of which the base is a [[parallelogram]], or equivalently a polyhedron with six faces which are all parallelograms.

A right rectangular prism is also called a ''[[cuboid]]'', or informally a ''rectangular box''. A right square prism is simply a ''square box'', and may also be called a ''square cuboid''.

==Volume==
The [[volume]] of a prism is the product of the [[area]] of the base and the distance between the two base faces, or the height (in the case of a non-right prism, note that this means the perpendicular distance).

The volume is therefore:
:<math>V = B \cdot h</math>

where ''B'' is the base area and ''h'' is the height. The volume of a prism whose base is a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] with side length ''s'' is therefore:
:<math>V = \frac{n}{4}hs^2 \cot\frac{\pi}{n}.</math>

==Surface area==
The surface [[area]] of a right prism is {{nowrap|2 · ''B'' + ''P'' · ''h''}}, where ''B'' is the area of the base, ''h'' the height, and ''P'' the base [[perimeter]].

The surface area of a right prism whose base is a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] with side length ''s'' and height ''h'' is therefore:

:<math>A = \frac{n}{2} s^2 \cot{\frac{\pi}{n}} + n s h.</math>

==Symmetry==
The [[symmetry group]] of a right ''n''-sided prism with regular base is [[dihedral group|D<sub>''n''h</sub>]] of order 4''n'', except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group [[octahedral symmetry|O<sub>h</sub>]] of order 48, which has three versions of D<sub>4h</sub> as [[subgroup]]s. The [[Point groups in three dimensions#Rotation groups|rotation group]] is D<sub>''n''</sub> of order 2''n'', except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 24, which has three versions of D<sub>4</sub> as subgroups.

The symmetry group D<sub>''n''h</sub> contains [[Point reflection|inversion]] [[If and only if|iff]] ''n'' is even.

==Prismatic polytope==
A ''prismatic [[polytope]]'' is a higher-dimensional generalization of a prism. An ''n''-dimensional prismatic polytope is constructed from two ({{nowrap|''n'' − 1}})-dimensional polytopes, translated into the next dimension.

The prismatic ''n''-polytope elements are doubled from the ({{nowrap|''n'' − 1}})-polytope elements and then creating new elements from the next lower element.

Take an ''n''-polytope with ''f<sub>i</sub>'' [[Face|''i''-face]] elements ({{nowrap|''i'' {{=}} 0, ..., ''n''}}). Its ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-polytope prism will have {{nowrap|2''f''<sub>''i''</sub> + ''f''<sub>''i''−1</sub>}} ''i''-face elements. (With {{nowrap|''f''<sub>−1</sub> {{=}} 0}}, {{nowrap|''f''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} 1}}.)

By dimension:
*Take a [[polygon]] with ''n'' vertices, ''n'' edges. Its prism has 2''n'' vertices, 3''n'' edges, and {{nowrap|2 + ''n''}} faces.
*Take a [[polyhedron]] with ''v'' vertices, ''e'' edges, and ''f'' faces. Its prism has 2''v'' vertices, {{nowrap|2''e'' + ''v''}} edges, {{nowrap|2''f'' + ''e''}} faces, and {{nowrap|2 + ''f''}} cells.
*Take a [[polychoron]] with ''v'' vertices, ''e'' edges, ''f'' faces and ''c'' cells. Its prism has 2''v'' vertices, {{nowrap|2''e'' + ''v''}} edges, {{nowrap|2''f'' + ''e''}} faces, and {{nowrap|2''c'' + ''f''}} cells, and {{nowrap|2 + ''c''}} hypercells.

===Uniform prismatic polytope===
A regular ''n''-polytope represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {{nowrap|{''p'', ''q'', ...,}}&nbsp;''t''} can form a uniform prismatic ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-polytope represented by a [[Cartesian product]] of [[Schläfli symbol#Prismatic_forms|two Schläfli symbols]]: {{nowrap|{''p'', ''q'', ...,}}&nbsp;''t''}×{}.

By dimension:
*A 0-polytopic prism is a [[line segment]], represented by an empty [[Schläfli symbol]] {}.
**[[Image:Complete graph K2.svg|60px]]
*A 1-polytopic prism is a [[rectangle]], made from 2 translated line segments. It is represented as the product Schläfli symbol {}×{}. If it is [[square]], symmetry can be reduced it: {{nowrap|{}×{} {{=}} {4}.}}
**[[Image:Square diagonals.svg|60px]]Example: Square, {}×{}, two parallel line segments, connected by two line segment ''sides''.
*A [[polygon]]al prism is a 3-dimensional prism made from two translated polygons connected by rectangles. A regular polygon {''p''} can construct a uniform ''n''-gonal prism represented by the product {''p''}×{}. If {{nowrap|''p'' {{=}} 4}}, with square sides symmetry it becomes a [[cube]]: {{nowrap|{4}×{} {{=}} {4,&nbsp;3}.}}
**[[Image:Pentagonal prism.png|60px]]Example: [[Pentagonal prism]], {5}×{}, two parallel [[pentagon]]s connected by 5 rectangular ''sides''.
*A [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] prism is a 4-dimensional prism made from two translated polyhedra connected by 3-dimensional prism cells. A regular polyhedron {''p'',&nbsp;''q''} can construct the uniform polychoric prism, represented by the product {''p'',&nbsp;''q''}×{}. If the polyhedron is a cube, and the sides are cubes, it becomes a [[tesseract]]: {4,&nbsp;3}×{} = {{nowrap|{4, 3, 3}.}}
**[[Image:Dodecahedral prism.png|50px]]Example: [[Dodecahedral prism]], {5,&nbsp;3}×{}, two parallel [[dodecahedron|dodecahedra]] connected by 12 pentagonal prism ''sides''.
*...

Higher order prismatic polytopes also exist as [[cartesian product]]s of any two polytopes. The dimension of a polytope is the product of the dimensions of the elements. The first example of these exist in 4-dimensional space are called [[duoprism]]s as the product of two polygons. Regular duoprisms are represented as {''p''}×{''q''}.
