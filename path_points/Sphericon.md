The '''sphericon''' is a three-dimensional solid with one side and two edges. It was first introduced by the Israeli game and toy inventor David Haran Hirsch who patented it in [[Israel]] in 1980.<ref>David Haran Hirsch (1980): "[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patent59720-specifications.pdf Patent no. 59720: A device for generating a meander motion]; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patent59720-drawings.pdf Patent drawings]; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patent59720-Application.pdf Patent application form]; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patent59720-claims.pdf Patent claims]</ref>  It was given its name by Colin Roberts, of [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], who also explored it.

It may be constructed from a [[bicone]] (a double [[cone (geometry)|cone]]) with an [[apex (geometry)|apex]] of 90 degrees, by splitting the bicone along a plane through both apexes, rotating one of the two halves by 90 degrees, and reattaching the two halves.

Alternatively, the surface of a sphericon can be formed by cutting and gluing a paper template in the form of four [[circular sector]]s (with [[central angle]]s π/√2) joined edge-to-edge [http://www.pjroberts.com/sphericon/images/nets/4n.jpg].

Like the [[Oloid]] and other [[Developable surface|developable]] rollers, when  rolled on a flat surface, every point on the surface of a sphericon comes in contact with the surface it is rolling on.

[[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] of the [[University of Warwick]] and Tony Phillips of [[Stony Brook University]] have also investigated the sphericon, and it has helped the latter develop theories about [[maze]]s.
