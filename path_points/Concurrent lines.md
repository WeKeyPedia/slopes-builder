[[Image:Brianchon's Theorem.svg|450px|right|Concurrent [[diagonal]]s of a [[hexagon]] with an inscribed [[conic]] ]]

In [[geometry]], three or more [[line (mathematics)|lines]] in a plane or higher-dimensional space are said to be '''concurrent''' if they [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] at a single [[point (geometry)|point]].

==Examples==

===Triangles===

In a [[triangle]], 4 basic types of sets of concurrent lines are [[Altitude (triangle)|altitudes]], [[Bisection#Angle bisector|angle bisectors]], [[Median (geometry)|medians]], and [[Bisection#Perpendicular bisectors|perpendicular bisectors]]:

* A triangle's altitudes run from each [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and meet the opposite side at a [[right angle]]. The point where the three altitudes meet is the [[orthocenter]].
* Angle bisectors are rays running from each vertex of the triangle and bisecting the associated [[angle]]. They all meet at the [[incenter]].
* Medians connect each vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. The three medians meet at the [[centroid]].
* Perpendicular bisectors are lines running out of the midpoints of each side of a triangle at 90 degree angles. The three perpendicular bisectors meet at the [[circumcenter]].

Other sets of lines associated with a triangle are concurrent as well. For example:

* Any median (which is necessarily a [[Bisection#Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors|bisector of the triangle's area]]) is concurrent with two other area bisectors each of which is parallel to a side.<ref>Dunn, J. A., and Pretty, J. E., "Halving a triangle," ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 56, May 1972, 105-108.</ref>

* A [[Cleaver (geometry)|cleaver]] of a triangle is a line segment that [[Bisection#Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors|bisects the perimeter]] of the triangle and has one endpoint at the midpoint of one of the three sides. The three cleavers concur at the center of the [[Spieker circle]], which is the [[incircle]] of the [[medial triangle]].

* A [[Splitter (geometry)|splitter]] of a triangle is a line segment having one endpoint at one of the three vertices of the triangle and bisecting the perimeter. The three splitters concur at the [[Nagel point]] of the triangle.

* Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's [[incenter]], and each triangle has one, two, or three of these lines.<ref>Kodokostas, Dimitrios, "Triangle Equalizers," ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'' 83, April 2010, pp. 141-146.</ref> Thus if there are three of them, they concur at the incenter.

* The [[Tarry point]] of a triangle is the point of concurrency of the lines through the vertices of the triangle perpendicular to the corresponding sides of the triangle's first [[Brocard triangle]].

* The [[Schiffler point]] of a triangle is the point of concurrence of the [[Euler line]]s of four triangles: the triangle in question, and the three triangles that each share two vertices with it and have its [[incenter]] as the other vertex.

* The [[Napoleon points]] and generalizations of them are points of concurrency. For example, the first Napoleon point is the point of concurrency of the three lines each from a vertex to the centroid of the equilateral triangle drawn on the exterior of the opposite side from the vertex.

* The [[de Longchamps point]] is the point of concurrence of several lines with the [[Euler line]].

* Three lines, each formed by drawing an external equilateral triangle on one of the sides of a given triangle and connecting the new vertex to the original triangle's opposite vertex, are concurrent at a point called the [[Triangle center#1st isogonic center|first isogonal center]]. In the case in which the original triangle has no angle greater than 120°, this point is also the [[Fermat point]].

===Quadrilaterals===

*The two [[Quadrilateral#Special line segments|bimedians]] of a [[quadrilateral]] (segments joining midpoints of opposite sides) and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are concurrent and are all bisected by their point of intersection.<ref name=Altshiller-Court>Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.</ref>{{rp|p.125}}

*In a [[tangential quadrilateral]], the four [[angle bisector]]s concur at the center of the [[incircle]].<ref>Andreescu, Titu and Enescu, Bogdan, ''Mathematical Olympiad Treasures'', Birkhäuser, 2006, pp. 64–68.</ref>

*Other concurrencies of a tangential quadrilateral are given [[Tangential quadrilateral#Concurrent and perpendicular lines|here]].

*In a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], four line segments, each [[perpendicular]] to one side and passing through the opposite side's [[midpoint]], are concurrent.<ref name=Altshiller-Court>{{citation |first=Nathan |last=Altshiller-Court |title=College Geometry: An Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle |year=2007 |publisher=Courier Dover |isbn=978-0-486-45805-2 |edition=2nd |origyear=1952 |oclc=78063045 |pages=131, 137–8}}</ref>{{rp|p.131;}}<ref>{{citation |first=Ross |last=Honsberger |title=Episodes in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Euclidean Geometry |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=6oduPgvOAhwC&pg=PA35 |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-88385-639-0 |pages=35–39 |chapter=4.2 Cyclic quadrilaterals |series=New Mathematical Library |volume=37}}</ref> These line segments are called the ''maltitudes'',<ref>{{mathworld|title=Maltitude|urlname=Maltitude}}</ref> which is an abbreviation for midpoint altitude. Their common point is called the ''anticenter''.

*A convex quadrilateral is [[Ex-tangential quadrilateral|ex-tangential]] if and only if there are six concurrent angles bisectors: the internal [[Bisection#Angle bisector|angle bisector]]s at two opposite vertex angles, the external angle bisectors at the other two vertex angles, and the external angle bisectors at the angles formed where the extensions of opposite sides intersect.

===Hexagons===

*If the successive sides of a [[Cyclic polygon|cyclic]] [[hexagon]] are ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f'', then the three main diagonals concur at a single point if and only if {{nowrap|''ace'' {{=}} ''bdf''}}.<ref>Cartensen, Jens, "About hexagons", ''Mathematical Spectrum'' 33(2) (2000-2001), 37-40.</ref>

*If a hexagon has an [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] [[conic]], then by [[Brianchon's theorem]] its principal [[diagonal]]s are concurrent (as in the above image).

*Concurrent lines arise in the dual of [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]].

*For each side of a cyclic hexagon, extend the adjacent sides to their intersection, forming a triangle exterior to the given side. Then the segments connecting the circumcenters of opposite triangles are concurrent.<ref>Nikolaos Dergiades, "Dao's theorem on six circumcenters associated with a cyclic hexagon", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 14, 2014, 243--246.  http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2014volume14/FG201424index.html </ref>

===Regular polygons===

*If a regular polygon has an even number of sides, the [[diagonal]]s connecting opposite vertices are concurrent at the center of the polygon.

===Circles===

*The [[Bisection#Line segment bisector|perpendicular bisectors]] of all [[Circle#Chord|chords]] of a [[circle]] are concurrent at the [[Center (geometry)|center]] of the circle.

*The lines perpendicular to the tangents to a circle at the points of tangency are concurrent at the center.

*All [[area]] [[Bisection|bisectors]] and [[perimeter]] bisectors of a circle are [[diameter]]s, and they are concurrent at the circle's center.

===Ellipses===

*All area bisectors and perimeter bisectors of an [[ellipse]] are concurrent at the center of the ellipse.

===Hyperbolas===

*In a [[hyperbola]] the following are concurrent: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.

*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.

===Tetrahedrons===

*In a [[tetrahedron]], the four medians and three bimedians are all concurrent at a point called the ''centroid'' of the tetrahedron.<ref>Leung, Kam-tim; and Suen, Suk-nam; "Vectors, matrices and geometry", Hong Kong University Press, 1994, pp. 53-54</ref>

*An [[Tetrahedron#Other special cases|isodynamic tetrahedron]] is one in which the [[cevian]]s that join the vertices to the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incenter]]s of the opposite faces are concurrent, and an [[Tetrahedron#Other special cases|isogonic tetrahedron]] has concurrent cevians that join the vertices to the points of contact of the opposite faces with the [[inscribed sphere]] of the tetrahedron.

*In an [[orthocentric tetrahedron]] the four altitudes are concurrent.

==Algebra==

According to the [[Rouché–Capelli theorem]], a system of equations is [[Consistent equations|consistent]] if and only if the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the [[coefficient matrix]] is equal to the rank of the [[augmented matrix]] (the coefficient matrix augmented with a column of intercept terms), and the system has a ''unique'' solution if and only if that common rank equals the number of variables. Thus with two variables the ''k'' lines in the plane, associated with a set of ''k'' equations, are concurrent if and only if the rank of the ''k'' × 2  coefficient matrix and the rank of the ''k'' × 3 augmented matrix are both 2. In that case only two of the ''k'' equations are [[independent equation|independent]], and the point of concurrency can be found by solving any two mutually independent equations simultaneously for the two variables.

==Projective geometry==

In [[projective geometry]], in two dimensions concurrency is the [[Duality (projective geometry)|dual]] of [[collinearity]]; in three dimensions, concurrency is the  dual of [[coplanarity]].
