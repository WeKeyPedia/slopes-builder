'''Sangaku''' or '''San Gaku''' (算額; lit. translation: calculation tablet) are Japanese geometrical problems or theorems, in [[Euclidean geometry]] on wooden tablets which were placed as offerings at [[Shinto shrine]]s or [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] during the [[Edo period]] (1603&ndash;1867) by members of all social classes.

==History==
[[File:Sangaku at Enmanji.jpg|thumb|A Sangaku dedicated at Enmanji Temple in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]]]
The Sangaku were painted in color on wooden tablets and hung in the precincts of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines as offerings to the kami and buddhas ([[Ema (Shinto)|ema]]), as challenges to the congregants, or as displays of the solutions to questions. Many of these tablets were lost during the period of [[modernization]] that followed the Edo period, but around nine hundred are known to remain.

[[Fujita Kagen]] (1765&ndash;1821), a Japanese mathematician of prominence, published the first collection of ''sangaku'' problems, his ''Shimpeki Sampo'' (Mathematical problems Suspended from the Temple) in 1790, and in 1806 a sequel, the ''Zoku Shimpeki Sampo''.

During this period [[Japan]] applied strict regulations  to commerce and foreign relations for western countries so the tablets were created using [[Japanese mathematics]], (''[[wasan]]''), developed in parallel to western mathematics. For example, the connection between an integral and its derivative (the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]) was unknown, so Sangaku problems on areas and volumes were solved by expansions in [[infinite series]] and term-by-term calculation.

A typical problem, which is presented on an 1824 tablet in the [[Gunma Prefecture]], covers the relationship of three touching circles with a common [[tangent]]. Given the size of the two outer large circles, what is the size of the small circle between them? ''The answer is:'' <!-- Info from ScAm May98 article -->

: <math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{r_\text{middle}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_\text{left}}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_\text{right}}}.</math>

===In the west===
[[Soddy's hexlet]], thought previously to have been discovered in the west in 1937, has been discovered on a Sangaku dating from 1822.
