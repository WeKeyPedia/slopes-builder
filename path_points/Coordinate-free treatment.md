A '''coordinate-free''', or '''component-free''', treatment of a [[scientific theory]] or [[mathematical]] topic develops its concepts on any form of [[manifold]] without reference to any particular [[coordinate system]]. 

==Benefits==
Coordinate-free treatments generally allow for simpler systems of equations and inherently constrain certain types of inconsistency, allowing greater [[mathematical elegance]] at the cost of some [[abstraction]] from the detailed formulae needed to evaluate these equations within a particular system of coordinates. 

==History==
Coordinate-free treatments were the only available approach to [[geometry]] (and are now known as [[synthetic geometry]]) before the development of [[analytic geometry]] by [[Descartes]]. After several centuries of generally coordinate-based exposition, the modern tendency is generally to introduce students to coordinate-free treatments early on, and then to derive the coordinate-based treatments from the coordinate-free treatment, rather than ''vice versa''.

==Applications==
Fields that are now often introduced with coordinate-free treatments include [[vector calculus]], [[tensor]]s, and [[differential geometry]].

In physics, the existence of coordinate-free treatments of physical theories is a corollary of the principle of [[general covariance]].
