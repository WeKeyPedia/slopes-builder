{{General geometry}}

'''Geometry''' (from the {{lang-grc|γεωμετρία}}; ''[[wikt:γῆ|geo-]]'' "earth", ''[[wikt:μέτρον|-metron]]'' "measurement") is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a [[geometer]]. Geometry arose independently in a number of early cultures as a body of practical knowledge concerning [[length]]s, [[area]]s, and [[volume]]s, with elements of formal [[mathematical science]] emerging in the West as early as [[Thales]] (6th century BC).  By the 3rd century BC, geometry was put into an [[axiomatic system|axiomatic form]] by [[Euclid]], whose treatment—[[Euclidean geometry]]—set a standard for many centuries to follow.<ref>Martin J. Turner,Jonathan M. Blackledge,Patrick R. Andrews (1998). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=oLXgFdfKp78C&pg=PA1&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Fractal geometry in digital imaging]''. [[Academic Press]]. p. 1. ISBN 0-12-703970-8</ref> [[Archimedes]] developed ingenious techniques for calculating areas and volumes, in many ways anticipating modern [[integral calculus]]. The field of [[astronomy]], especially as it relates to mapping the positions of [[star]]s and [[planet]]s on the [[celestial sphere]] and describing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, served as an important source of geometric problems during the next one and a half millennia. In the classical world, both geometry and astronomy were considered to be part of the [[Quadrivium]], a subset of the seven [[liberal arts#History|liberal arts]] considered essential for a free citizen to master.

The introduction of [[coordinates]] by [[René Descartes]] and the concurrent developments of [[algebra]] marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric figures such as [[plane curve]]s could now be represented [[analytic geometry|analytically]] in the form of functions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in the 17th century. Furthermore, the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric properties of figures: perspective is the origin of [[projective geometry]]. The subject of geometry was further enriched by the study of the intrinsic structure of geometric objects that originated with [[Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and led to the creation of [[topology]] and [[differential geometry]].

In Euclid's time, there was no clear distinction between physical and geometrical [[space]]. Since the 19th-century discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the concept of space has undergone a radical transformation and raised the question of which geometrical space best fits physical space.
With the rise of formal mathematics in the 20th century, 'space' (whether 'point', 'line', or 'plane') lost its intuitive contents, so today one has to distinguish between physical space, geometrical spaces (in which 'space', 'point' etc. still have their intuitive meanings) and abstract spaces.
Contemporary geometry considers [[manifold]]s, spaces that are considerably more abstract than the familiar [[Euclidean space]], which they only approximately resemble at small scales. These spaces may be endowed with additional structure which allow one to speak about length. Modern geometry has many ties to [[physics]] as is exemplified by the links between [[pseudo-Riemannian]] geometry and [[general relativity]]. One of the youngest physical theories, [[string theory]], is also very geometric in flavour.

While the visual nature of geometry makes it initially more accessible than other mathematical areas such as algebra or [[number theory]], geometric language is also used in contexts far removed from its traditional, Euclidean provenance (for example, in [[fractal geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]]).<ref>It is quite common in algebraic geometry to speak about ''geometry of [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s'', possibly [[singularity theory|singular]]. From a naïve perspective, these objects are just finite sets of points, but by invoking powerful geometric imagery and using well developed geometric techniques, it is possible to find structure and establish properties that make them somewhat analogous to the ordinary [[sphere]]s or [[Cone (geometry)|cones]].</ref>

==Overview==

Because the recorded development of geometry spans more than two [[millennia]], it is hardly surprising that perceptions of what constitutes geometry have evolved throughout the ages:

===Practical geometry===
Geometry originated as a practical science concerned with surveys, measurements, areas, and volumes. Among other highlights, notable accomplishments include formulas for  [[length]]s, [[area]]s and [[volume]]s, such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[circumference]] and [[area of a disk|area]] of a circle, area of a [[triangle]], volume of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[sphere]], and a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]. A method of computing certain inaccessible distances or heights based on [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]] of geometric figures is attributed to [[Thales]]. The development of [[astronomy]] led to the emergence of [[trigonometry]] and [[spherical trigonometry]], together with the attendant computational techniques.

===Axiomatic geometry===
[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of Euclid's [[parallel postulate]]]]
{{See also|Euclidean geometry}}
[[Euclid]] took a more abstract approach in his [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], one of the most influential books ever written. Euclid introduced certain [[axiom]]s, or [[postulate]]s, expressing primary or self-evident properties of points, lines, and planes. He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid's approach to geometry was its rigor, and it has come to be known as ''axiomatic'' or ''[[synthetic geometry|synthetic]]'' geometry. At the start of the 19th century, the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometries]] by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] (1792–1856), [[János Bolyai]] (1802–1860) and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) and others led to a revival of interest in this discipline, and in the 20th century, [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943) employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry.

===Geometric constructions===
{{Main|Compass and straightedge constructions}}
Classical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments allowed in geometric constructions are the [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] and [[ruler|straightedge]]. Also, every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However, some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means alone, and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other curves, as well as mechanical devices, were found.

===Numbers in geometry===
[[File:Square root of 2 triangle.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Pythagoreans discovered that the sides of a  triangle could have [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lengths.]]
In [[ancient Greece]] the [[Pythagoreans]] considered the role of numbers in geometry. However, the discovery of incommensurable lengths, which contradicted their philosophical views, made them abandon abstract numbers in favor of concrete geometric quantities, such as length and area of figures. Numbers were reintroduced into geometry in the form of [[coordinate]]s by [[Descartes]], who realized that the study of geometric shapes can be facilitated by their algebraic representation, and whom the [[Cartesian plane]] is named. [[Analytic geometry]] applies methods of algebra to geometric questions, typically by relating geometric [[curve]]s to algebraic [[equation]]s. These ideas played a key role in the development of [[calculus]] in the 17th century and led to the discovery of many new properties of plane curves. Modern [[algebraic geometry]] considers similar questions on a vastly more abstract level.

===Geometry of position===
{{Main|Projective geometry|Topology}}
Even in ancient times, geometers considered questions of relative position or spatial relationship of geometric figures and shapes. Some examples are given by inscribed and circumscribed circles of [[polygon]]s, lines intersecting and tangent to [[conic section]]s, the [[Pappus configuration|Pappus]] and [[Menelaus theorem|Menelaus]] configurations of points and lines. In the Middle Ages, new and more complicated questions of this type were considered: What is the maximum number of spheres simultaneously touching a given sphere of the same radius ([[kissing number problem]])? What is the densest [[sphere packing|packing of spheres]] of equal size in space ([[Kepler conjecture]])? Most of these questions involved 'rigid' geometrical shapes, such as lines or spheres. [[Projective geometry|Projective]], [[Convex geometry|convex]], and [[discrete geometry]] are three sub-disciplines within present day geometry that deal with these types of questions.

[[Leonhard Euler]], in studying problems like the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]], considered the most fundamental properties of geometric figures based solely on shape, independent of their metric properties. Euler called this new branch of geometry ''geometria situs'' (geometry of place), but it is now known as [[topology]]. Topology grew out of geometry, but turned into a large independent discipline. It does not differentiate between objects that can be continuously deformed into each other. The objects may nevertheless retain some geometry, as in the case of [[hyperbolic knot]]s.

===Geometry beyond Euclid===
[[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|right|[[Differential geometry]] uses tools from [[calculus]] to study problems involving curvature.]]
In the nearly two thousand years since Euclid, while the range of geometrical questions asked and answered inevitably expanded, the basic understanding of [[space]] remained essentially the same. [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that there is only one, ''absolute'', geometry, which is known to be true ''a priori'' by an inner faculty of mind: Euclidean geometry was [[synthetic a priori]].<ref>Kline (1972) "Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times", Oxford University Press, p. 1032.  Kant did not reject the logical (analytic a priori) ''possibility'' of non-Euclidean geometry, see [[Jeremy Gray]], "Ideas of Space Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Relativistic", Oxford, 1989; p. 85.  Some have implied that, in light of this, Kant had in fact ''predicted'' the development of non-Euclidean geometry, cf. Leonard Nelson, "Philosophy and Axiomatics," Socratic Method and Critical Philosophy, Dover, 1965, p. 164.</ref>  This dominant view was overturned by the revolutionary discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in the works of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss (who never published his theory). They demonstrated that ordinary [[Euclidean space]] is only one possibility for development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then expressed  by [[Riemann]] in his 1867 inauguration lecture ''Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen'' (''On the hypotheses on which geometry is based''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/|title=Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen.|publisher=}}</ref> published only after his death. Riemann's new idea of space proved crucial in [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity theory]], and [[Riemannian geometry]], that considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a mainstay of modern geometry.

===Dimension===

[[File:Von Koch curve.gif|thumb| The [[Koch snowflake]], with [[fractal dimension]]=log4/log3 and [[topological dimension]]=1]]
Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a [[line (geometry)|line]]), 2 (a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as [[three-dimensional space]]), mathematicians have used [[higher dimension]]s for nearly two centuries. Dimension has gone through stages of being any [[natural number]] ''n'', possibly infinite with the introduction of [[Hilbert space]], and any positive real number in [[fractal geometry]]. [[Dimension theory]] is a technical area, initially within [[general topology]], that discusses ''definitions''; in common with most mathematical ideas, dimension is now defined rather than an intuition. Connected [[topological manifold]]s have a well-defined dimension; this is a theorem ([[invariance of domain]]) rather than anything ''a priori''.

The issue of dimension still matters to geometry, in the absence of complete answers to classic questions. Dimensions 3 of space and 4 of [[space-time]] are special cases in [[geometric topology]]. Dimension 10 or 11 is a key number in [[string theory]]. Research may bring a satisfactory ''geometric'' reason for the significance of 10 and 11 dimensions. <!-- Exactly why is something to which research may bring a satisfactory ''geometric'' answer.-->

===Symmetry===
[[File:Order-3 heptakis heptagonal tiling.png|right|thumb|A [[Order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling|tiling]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]]]
The theme of [[symmetry]] in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry itself. Symmetric shapes such as the [[circle]], [[regular polygon]]s and [[platonic solid]]s held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. Symmetric patterns occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of [[M. C. Escher]]. Nonetheless, it was not until the second half of 19th century that the unifying role of symmetry in foundations of geometry was recognized. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed that, in a very precise sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation [[group (mathematics)|group]], determines what geometry ''is''. Symmetry in classical [[Euclidean geometry]] is represented by [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]]s and rigid motions, whereas in [[projective geometry]] an analogous role is played by [[collineation]]s, [[geometric transformation]]s that take straight lines into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, Riemann, [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]] and Klein, and [[Sophus Lie]] that Klein's idea to 'define a geometry via its [[symmetry group]]' proved most influential. Both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former in [[topology]] and [[geometric group theory]], the latter in [[Lie theory]] and [[Riemannian geometry]].

A different type of symmetry is the principle of duality in [[projective geometry]] (see [[Duality (projective geometry)]]) among other fields. This meta-phenomenon can roughly be described as follows: in any [[theorem]], exchange ''point'' with ''plane'', ''join'' with ''meet'', ''lies in'' with ''contains'', and you will get an equally true theorem. A similar and closely related form of duality exists between a [[vector space]] and its dual space.

In the 7th century BC, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Thales of Miletus]] used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore.

Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time,<ref>{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}}</ref> introduced [[mathematical rigor]] through the [[axiomatic method]] and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.

[[Indian mathematics|Indian]] mathematicians also made many important contributions in geometry. The ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' (ninth century BC) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the ''[[Shulba Sutras|Sulba Sutras]]''.<ref>{{Harv|Staal|1999}}</ref> According to {{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=363}}, the ''Śulba Sūtras'' contain "the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians.

It is not certain what practical use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These conditions led to certain "Diophantine" problems, a particular case of which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square integer equal to the sum of two others."</ref>
In the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also "employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero."<ref name=hayashi2005-371>{{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=371}}</ref> [[Aryabhata]]'s ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499) includes the computation of areas and volumes.
[[Brahmagupta]] wrote his astronomical work ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|{{IAST|Brāhma Sphuṭa Siddhānta}}]]'' in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 [[Sanskrit]] verses, was divided into two sections: "basic operations" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and "practical mathematics" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain).<ref name=hayashi2003-p121-122>{{Harv|Hayashi|2003|pp=121–122}}</ref> In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]]. Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of [[Heron's formula]]), as well as a complete description of [[rational triangle]]s (''i.e.'' triangles with rational sides and rational areas).<ref name=hayashi2003-p121-122/>

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[mathematics in medieval Islam]] contributed to the development of geometry, especially [[algebraic geometry]]<ref>R.

Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the 16th century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain.

Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines – made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') – was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources.

In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[equation]]s, by [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) and [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of [[calculus]] and a precise quantitative science of [[physics]]. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of [[projective geometry]] by [[Girard Desargues]] (1591–1661). Projective geometry is a geometry without measurement or parallel lines, just the study of how points are related to each other.

Two developments in geometry in the 19th century changed the way it had been studied previously. These were the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, János Bolyai and Carl Friedrich Gauss and of the formulation of [[symmetry]] as the central consideration in the [[Erlangen Programme]] of [[Felix Klein]] (which generalized the Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries). Two of the master geometers of the time were [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826–1866), working primarily with tools from [[mathematical analysis]], and introducing the [[Riemann surface]], and [[Henri Poincaré]], the founder of [[algebraic topology]] and the geometric theory of [[dynamical system]]s. As a consequence of these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of "space" became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as different as [[complex analysis]] and [[classical mechanics]].

==Contemporary geometry==
===Euclidean geometry===
[[File:E8Petrie.svg|right|thumb|120px|The [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub>polytope]], orthogonally projected into the [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] [[Lie group]] [[Coxeter plane]]]]
[[Euclidean geometry]] has become closely connected with [[computational geometry]], [[computer graphics]], [[convex geometry]], [[incidence geometry]], [[finite geometry]], [[discrete geometry]], and some areas of [[combinatorics]]. Attention was given to further work on Euclidean geometry and the Euclidean groups by [[crystallography]] and the work of [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], and can be seen in theories of [[Coxeter group]]s and polytopes. [[Geometric group theory]] is an expanding area of the theory of more general [[discrete group]]s, drawing on geometric models and algebraic techniques.

===Differential geometry===
[[Differential geometry]] has been of increasing importance to [[mathematical physics]] due to [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] postulation that the [[universe]] is [[curvature|curved]]. Contemporary differential geometry is ''intrinsic'', meaning that the spaces it considers are [[smooth manifold]]s whose geometric structure is governed by a [[Riemannian metric]], which determines how distances are measured near each point, and not ''a priori'' parts of some ambient flat Euclidean space.

===Topology and geometry===

The field of [[topology]], which saw massive development in the 20th century, is in a technical sense a type of [[transformation geometry]], in which transformations are [[homeomorphism]]s. This has often been expressed in the form of the dictum 'topology is rubber-sheet geometry'. Contemporary [[geometric topology]] and [[differential topology]], and particular subfields such as [[Morse theory]], would be counted by most mathematicians as part of geometry. [[Algebraic topology]] and [[general topology]] have gone their own ways.

===Algebraic geometry===

The field of [[algebraic geometry]] is the modern incarnation of the [[Cartesian geometry]] of [[co-ordinates]]. From late 1950s through mid-1970s it had undergone major foundational development, largely due to work of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. This led to the introduction of [[scheme (algebraic geometry)|schemes]] and greater emphasis on [[algebraic topology|topological]] methods, including various [[cohomology theory|cohomology theories]]. One of seven [[Millennium Prize problems]], the [[Hodge conjecture]], is a question in algebraic geometry.

The study of low-dimensional algebraic varieties, [[algebraic curve]]s, [[algebraic surface]]s and algebraic varieties of dimension 3 ("algebraic threefolds"), has been far advanced. [[Gröbner basis]] theory and [[real algebraic geometry]] are among more applied subfields of modern algebraic geometry. [[Arithmetic geometry]] is an active field combining algebraic geometry and [[number theory]]. Other directions of research involve [[moduli space]]s and [[complex geometry]]. Algebro-geometric methods are commonly applied in [[string theory|string]] and [[brane theory|brane]] <!--This comment might stop AWB messing up the formatting here--> theory.
