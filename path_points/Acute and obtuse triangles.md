An '''acute triangle''' is a [[triangle]] with all three of its [[angle]]s being acute (less than 90°), while an '''obtuse triangle''' is one that has one obtuse angle (greater than 90°) and two acute angles. Since a triangle's angles sum to 180°, no triangle has more than one obtuse angle.

Acute and obtuse triangles are the two different types of '''oblique triangles'''&mdash;those which are not [[right triangle]]s in that they do not have a 90° angle.

==Properties==

In all triangles, the [[centroid]]&mdash;the intersection of the [[median (geometry)|medians]], each of which connects a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side&mdash;and the [[incenter]]&mdash;the center of the circle that is internally tangent to all three sides&mdash;are in the interior of the triangle. However, while the [[orthocenter]] and the [[circumcenter]] are in an acute triangle's interior, they are exterior to an obtuse triangle.

The orthocenter is the intersection point of the triangle's three [[altitude (triangle)|altitudes]], each of which [[perpendicular]]ly connects a side to the opposite [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. In the case of an acute triangle, all three of these segments lie entirely in the triangle's interior, and so they intersect in the interior. But for an obtuse triangle, the altitudes from the two acute angles intersect only the [[extended side|extensions]] of the opposite sides. These altitudes
fall entirely outside the triangle, resulting in their intersection with each other (and hence with the extended altitude from the obtuse-angled vertex) occurring in the triangle's exterior.

Likewise, a triangle's circumcenter&mdash;the intersection of the three sides' [[Bisection#Perpendicular bisectors of sides|perpendicular bisectors]], which is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices&mdash;falls inside an acute triangle but outside an obtuse triangle.

The [[right triangle]] is the in-between case: both its circumcenter and its orthocenter lie on its boundary.

In any triangle, any two angle measures ''A'' and ''B'' opposite sides ''a'' and ''b'' respectively are related according to<ref name=PL>[[Alfred Posamentier|Posamentier, Alfred S.]] and Lehmann, Ingmar. ''The Secrets of Triangles'', Prometheus Books, 2012.</ref>{{rp|p. 264}}

:<math>A>B \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a > b.</math>

This implies that the longest side in an obtuse triangle is the one opposite the obtuse-angled vertex.

An acute triangle has three [[inscribed figure|inscribed squares]], each with one side coinciding with part of a side of the triangle and with the square's other two vertices on the remaining two sides of the triangle. (In a right triangle two of these are merged into the same square, so there are only two distinct inscribed squares.) However, an obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, one of whose sides coincides with part of the longest side of the triangle.<ref name=Ox>Oxman, Victor,  and Stupel, Moshe. "Why are the side lengths of the squares inscribed in a triangle so close to each other?"

==Inequalities==
{{See also|List of triangle inequalities}}

===Sides===

If angle ''C'' is obtuse then for sides ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' we have<ref name=Crux>''Inequalities proposed in “Crux Mathematicorum”'', [http://www.imomath.com/othercomp/Journ/ineq.pdf].</ref>{{rp|p.1,#74}}

:<math>\frac{c^2}{2} < a^2+b^2 < c^2,</math>

with the left inequality approaching equality in the limit only as the apex angle of an isosceles triangle approaches 180°, and with the right inequality approaching equality only as the obtuse angle approaches 90°.

If  the triangle is acute then

:<math>a^2+b^2 > c^2, \quad b^2+c^2 > a^2, \quad c^2+a^2 > b^2.</math>

===Altitude===
If C is the greatest angle and ''h''<sub>''c''</sub> is the altitude from vertex ''C'', then for an acute triangle<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.135,#3109}}

:<math>\frac{1}{h_c^2} < \frac{1}{a^2}+\frac{1}{b^2},</math>

with the opposite inequality if C is obtuse.

===Medians===

With longest side ''c'' and [[median (geometry)|medians]] ''m''<sub>''a''</sub> and ''m''<sub>''b''</sub> from the other sides,<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.136,#3110}}

:<math>4c^2 +9a^2b^2 > 16m_a^2m_b^2</math>

for an acute triangle but with the inequality reversed for an obtuse triangle.

The median ''m''<sub>''c''</sub> from the longest side is greater or less than the circumradius for an acute or obtuse triangle respectively:<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.136,#3113}}

:<math>m_c > R</math>

for acute triangles, with the opposite for obtuse triangles.

===Trigonometric functions===

For an acute triangle we have, for angles ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'',<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.26,#954}}

:<math>\cos^2A+\cos^2B+\cos^2C < 1,</math>

with the reverse inequality holding for an obtuse triangle.

For an acute triangle with circumradius ''R'',<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.141,#3167}}

:<math>a\cos^3 A +b\cos^3 B +c\cos^3 C \leq \frac{abc}{4R^2}</math>

and<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.155,#S25}}

:<math>\cos^3A+\cos^3B+\cos^3C+\cos A\cos B\cos C\geq\frac{1}{2}.</math>

For an acute triangle,<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.115,#2874}}

:<math>\sin^2 A+\sin^2 B+\sin^2 C > 2,</math>

with the reverse inequality for an obtuse triangle.

For an acute triangle,<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p178,#241.1}}

:<math>\sin A \cdot \sin B +\sin B \cdot \sin C + \sin C \cdot \sin A \leq (\cos A+\cos B+\cos C)^2.</math>

For any triangle the [[triple tangent identity]] states that the sum of the angles' [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangents]] equals their product. Since an acute angle has a positive tangent value while an obtuse angle has a negative one, the expression for the product of the tangents shows that

:<math>\tan A+\tan B+\tan C = \tan A \cdot \tan B \cdot \tan C > 0</math>

for acute triangles, while the opposite direction of inequality holds for obtuse triangles.

We have<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.26,#958}}

:<math>\tan A +\tan B+\tan C \geq 2(\sin 2A+\sin 2B+\sin 2C)</math>

for acute triangles, and the reverse for obtuse triangles.

For all acute triangles,<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.40,#1210}}

:<math>(\tan A+\tan B+\tan C)^2 \geq (\sec A+1)^2+(\sec B+1)^2+(\sec C+1)^2.</math>

For all acute triangles with [[inradius]] ''r'' and [[circumradius]] ''R'',<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.53,#1424}}

:<math>a\tan A+ b\tan B+c\tan C \geq 10R-2r.</math>

For an acute triangle with area ''K'', <ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.103,#2662}}

:<math>(\sqrt{\cot A}+\sqrt{\cot B}+\sqrt{\cot C})^2 \leq \frac{K}{r^2}.</math>

===Circumradius, inradius, and exradii===

The sum of the circumradius ''R'' and the inradius ''r'' is less than or greater than half the sum of the shortest sides ''a'' and ''b'' as the triangle is acute or obtuse:<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.105,#2690}}

:<math>R+r < \frac{a+b}{2}</math>

if the triangle is acute, while the reverse inequality holds for an obtuse triangle.

For an acute triangle with [[median (triangle)|medians]] ''m''<sub>''a''</sub> , ''m''<sub>''b''</sub> , and ''m''<sub>''c''</sub> and circumradius ''R'', we have<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.26,#954}}

:<math>m_a^2+m_b^2+m_c^2 > 6R^2</math>

while the opposite inequality holds for an obtuse triangle.

Also, an acute triangle satisfies<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.26,#954}}

:<math>r^2+r_a^2+r_b^2+r_c^2 < 8R^2,</math>

in terms of the [[excircle]] radii ''r<sub>''a''</sub> ,   ''r<sub>''b''</sub> , and  ''r<sub>''c''</sub> ,
again with the reverse inequality holding for an obtuse triangle.

For an acute triangle with semiperimeter ''s'',<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.115,#2874}}

:<math>s-r >2R, </math>

and the reverse inequality holds for an obtuse triangle.

For an acute triangle with area ''K'',<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.185,#291.6}}

:<math>ab+bc+ca \geq 2R(R+r)+\frac{8K}{\sqrt{3}}.</math>

===Distances involving triangle centers===

For an acute triangle the distance between the circumcenter ''O'' and the orthocenter ''H'' satisfies<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.26,#954}}

:<math>OH < R,</math>

with the opposite inequality holding for an obtuse triangle.

For an acute triangle the distance between the incircle center ''I'' and orthocenter ''H'' satisfies<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.26,#954}}

:<math>IH < r\sqrt{2},</math>

where ''r'' is the [[inradius]], with the reverse inequality for an obtuse triangle.

===Inscribed square===

If one of the inscribed squares of an acute triangle has side length ''x''<sub>''a''</sub> and another has side length ''x''<sub>''b''</sub> with ''x''<sub>''a''</sub> < ''x''<sub>''b''</sub>, then<ref name=Ox/>{{rp|p. 115}}

:<math>1 \geq \frac{x_a}{x_b} \geq \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \approx 0.94.</math>

===Two triangles===

If two obtuse triangles have sides (''a, b, c'') and (''p, q, r'') with ''c'' and ''r'' being the respective longest sides, then<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.29,#1030}}

:<math>ap+bq < cr.</math>

==Examples==
===Triangles with special names===

The [[Calabi triangle]], which is the only non-equilateral triangle for which the largest square that fits in the interior can be positioned in any of three different ways, is obtuse and isosceles with base angles 39.1320261...° and third angle 101.7359477...°.

The [[equilateral triangle]], with three 60° angles, is acute.

The [[Morley triangle]], formed from any triangle by the intersections of its adjacent angle trisectors, is equilateral and hence acute.

The [[golden triangle (mathematics)|golden triangle]] is the [[isosceles triangle]] in which the ratio of the duplicated side to the [[base (geometry)|base side]] equals the [[golden ratio]]. It is acute, with angles 36°, 72°, and 72°, making it the only triangle with angles in the proportions 1:2:2.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Elam|first=Kimberly|year=2001|title=Geometry of Design|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |location=New York|isbn=1-56898-249-6|url=http://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Design-Studies-Proportion-Composition/dp/1568982496/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1288121120&sr=1-1}}</ref>

===Triangles with integer sides===

The only triangle with consecutive integers for an altitude and the sides is acute, having sides (13,14,15) and altitude from side 14 equal to 12.

The smallest-perimeter triangle with integer sides in arithmetic progression, and the smallest-perimeter integer-sided triangle with distinct sides, is obtuse: namely the one with sides (2, 3, 4).

The only triangles with one angle being twice another and having integer sides in [[arithmetic progression]] are acute: namely, the (4,5,6) triangle and its multiples.<ref name="Mitchell 2:3:4">Mitchell, Douglas W., "The 2:3:4, 3:4:5, 4:5:6, and 3:5:7 triangles," ''Mathematical Gazette'' 92, July 2008.</ref> 

There are no acute [[integer triangle|integer-sided triangles]]  with [[area]] = [[perimeter]], but there are three obtuse ones, having sides<ref>[[L. E. Dickson]], ''[[History of the Theory of Numbers]], vol.2'', 181.</ref> (6,25,29), (7,15,20), and (9,10,17).

The smallest integer-sided triangle with three rational [[Median (geometry)|medians]] is acute, with sides<ref name="Sierpinski">Sierpiński, Wacław. ''Pythagorean Triangles'', Dover Publ., 2003 (orig. 1962).</ref>  (68, 85, 87).

[[Heron triangle]]s have integer sides and integer area. The oblique Heron triangle with the smallest perimeter is acute, with sides (6, 5, 5). The two oblique Heron triangles that share the smallest area are the acute one with sides (6, 5, 5) and the obtuse one with sides (8, 5, 5), the area of each being 12.
