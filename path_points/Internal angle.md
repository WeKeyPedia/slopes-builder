In [[geometry]], an [[angle]] of a [[polygon]] is formed by two sides of the polygon that share an endpoint.  For a simple (non-self-intersecting) polygon, regardless of whether it is [[Polygon#Convexity and types of non-convexity|convex or non-convex]] this angle is called an [[Interior (topology)|'''interior''']] '''angle''' (or '''internal angle''') if a point within the angle is in the interior of the polygon. A polygon has exactly one internal angle per [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]].

If every internal angle of a simple polygon is less than 180°, the polygon is called [[convex polygon|convex]].

In contrast, an [[Interior (topology)|'''exterior''']] '''angle''' (or '''external angle''') is an angle formed by one side of a simple polygon and a line extended from an adjacent side.<ref>Weisstein, Eric W. "Exterior Angle Bisector." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExteriorAngleBisector.html</ref><ref name=PL>Posamentier, Alfred S., and Lehmann, Ingmar.

* The sum of the internal angle and the external angle on the same vertex is 180°.
* The sum of all the internal angles of a simple polygon is 180(''n''-2)° where ''n'' is the number of sides. The formula can be proved using [[mathematical induction]] and starting with a triangle for which the angle sum is 180°, then replacing one side with two sides connected at a vertex, and so on.
* The sum of the external angles of any simple convex or non-convex polygon is 360°.
* The measure of the exterior angle at a vertex is unaffected by which side is extended: the two exterior angles that can be formed at a vertex by extending alternately one side or the other are [[vertical angles]] and thus are equal.

The interior angle concept can be extended in a consistent way to crossed polygons such as [[star polygon]]s by using the concept of [[directed angles]]. In general, the interior angle sum in degrees of any closed polygon, including crossed (self-intersecting) ones, is then given by 180(''n''-2''k'')° where ''n'' is the number of vertices and ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, 3 ... represents the number of total revolutions of 360° one undergoes walking around the perimeter of the polygon.  In other words, 360''k''° represents the sum of all the exterior angles. For example, for ordinary convex and concave polygons ''k'' = 1, since the exterior angle sum = 360° and one undergoes only one full revolution walking around the perimeter.
