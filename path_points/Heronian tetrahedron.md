A '''Heronian tetrahedron''' is a [[tetrahedron]] whose side lengths, face areas and volume are all [[rational number]]s. The faces must therefore all be [[Heronian triangle]]s.

A tetrahedron with rational sides is not necessarily a Heronian tetrahedron because its face areas and volume may not be rational numbers. A Heronian tetrahedron is sometimes called a '''perfect tetrahedron'''.

117 is the smallest possible length of the longest side of a perfect tetrahedron with integral sidelengths. Its other sidelengths are 51, 52, 53, 80 and 84.
