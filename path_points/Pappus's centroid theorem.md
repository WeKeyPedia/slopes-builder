[[File:Pappus centroid theorem areas.gif|thumb|right|400px|The theorem applied to an open cylinder, cone and a sphere to obtain their surface areas. The centroids are at a distance ''a'' (in red) from the axis of rotation.]]

In mathematics, '''Pappus' centroid theorem''' (also known as  the '''Guldinus theorem''', '''Pappus–Guldinus theorem''' or '''Pappus' theorem''') is either of two related [[theorem]]s dealing with the [[surface area]]s and [[volume]]s of [[Surface_of_revolution|surface]]s and [[Solid_of_revolution|solid]]s of revolution.

The theorem is attributed to [[Pappus of Alexandria]] and [[Paul Guldin]].

==The first theorem==
The first theorem states that the [[surface area]] ''A'' of a [[surface of revolution]] generated by rotating a [[plane curve]] ''C'' about an [[axis of rotation|axis]] external to ''C'' and on the same plane is equal to the product of the [[arc length]] ''s'' of ''C'' and the distance ''d'' traveled by its [[Centroid|geometric centroid]].

: <math>A = sd.\,</math>

For example, the surface area of the [[torus]] with minor [[radius]] ''r'' and major radius ''R'' is 

: <math>A = (2\pi r)(2\pi R) = 4\pi^2 R r.\,</math>

==The second theorem==
The second theorem states that the [[volume]] ''V'' of a [[solid of revolution]] generated by rotating a [[plane figure]] ''F'' about an external axis is equal to the product of the area ''A'' of ''F'' and the distance ''d'' traveled by its geometric centroid.

: <math>V = Ad.\,</math>

For example, the volume of the [[torus]] with minor radius ''r'' and major radius ''R'' is 

: <math>V = (\pi r^2)(2\pi R) = 2\pi^2 R r^2.\,</math>

==Generalizations==

The theorem can be generalized for arbitrary curves and shapes, under appropriate conditions.<ref name=generalizations>{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=A.
