'''Synthetic geometry''' (sometimes referred to as [[axiomatic geometry]] or even '''pure geometry''') is the study of [[geometry]] [[Coordinate-free|without the use of coordinates]]. According to [[Felix Klein]],<ref>{{harvnb|Klein|1948|loc=p. 55}}</ref>
<blockquote>
Synthetic geometry is that which studies figures as such, without recourse to formulas, whereas analytic geometry consistently makes use of such formulas as can be written down after the adoption of an appropriate system of coordinates.
</blockquote>
A defining characteristic of synthetic geometry is the use of the [[axiomatic method]] to draw conclusions and solve problems, as opposed to [[analytic geometry|analytic]] and [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] geometries, where one would use [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[algebra|algebraic techniques]] to obtain these geometric results.

[[Euclidean geometry]], as presented by [[Euclid]], is the quintessential example of the use of the synthetic method. However, only after the introduction of coordinate methods was there a reason to introduce the term "synthetic geometry" to distinguish this approach to the subject. As a field of study, synthetic geometry was most prominent during the nineteenth century when some geometers rejected coordinate methods in establishing the foundations of [[projective geometry]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]].

==Logical synthesis==
The process of logical synthesis begins with some arbitrary but definite starting point. This starting point is the introduction of primitive notions or primitives and axioms about these primitives:
* '''[[Primitive notion|Primitives]]''' are the most basic ideas. Typically they include objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things like ''points'', ''lines'' and ''planes'' while a fundamental relationship is that of ''incidence''  – of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs,<ref>{{harvnb|Greenberg|1974|loc=p. 59}}</ref> his point being that the primitive terms are just empty shells, place holders if you will, and have no intrinsic properties.
* '''[[Axiom]]s''' are statements about these primitives; for example, ''any two points are together incident with just one line'' (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are  the ''building blocks'' of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.

From a given set of axioms, synthesis proceeds as a carefully constructed logical argument. When a significant result is proved rigorously, it becomes a '''[[theorem]]'''.

===Properties of axiom sets===
The axiom set for geometry is not fixed, in that there is more than one consistent set which can be chosen. Each such set leads to a different geometry.

Historically Euclid's parallel axiom or postulate has turned out to be optional. Simply discarding it gives [[projective geometry]] while modifying it yields an appropriate geometry such as [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]], [[spherical geometry|spherical]] or [[affine geometry|affine]] geometry.

Axioms of continuity and "between" are also optional, for example [[discrete geometry|discrete geometries]] may be created by discarding or modifying them.

Since the [[Erlangen program]] of Klein, the nature of any given geometry has been seen as the connection of [[symmetry]] and the content of propositions, rather than the style of development.

==History==
Euclid's original treatment remained unchallenged for over two thousand years, until the simultaneous discoveries of the non-Euclidean hyberbolic geometry by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]] during the early part of the nineteenth century led mathematicians to question Euclid's underlying assumptions.<ref>Mlodinow 2001, Part III The Story of Gauss</ref>

One of the early French analysts summarized synthetic geometry this way:
:''The Elements'' of Euclid are treated by the synthetic method. This author, after having posed the ''axioms'', and formed the requisites, established the propositions which he proves successively being supported by that which preceded, proceeding always from the ''simple to compound'', which is the essential character of synthesis.<ref>[[S. F. Lacroix]] (1816) ''Essais sur L'Enseignement en Général, et sur celui des Mathématiques en Particulier'', page 207, Libraire pur les Mathématiques.</ref>

The heyday of synthetic geometry can be considered to have been the 19th century, when analytic methods based on [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[calculus]] were ignored by some [[list of geometers|geometers]] such as [[Jakob Steiner]], in favor of a purely synthetic development of  [[projective geometry]]. For example, the treatment of the [[projective plane]] starting from axioms of incidence is actually a broader theory (with more [[model theory#Definition|model]]s) than is found by starting with a [[vector space]] of dimension three. Projective geometry has in fact the simplest and most elegant synthetic expression of any geometry.

In his [[Erlangen program]], [[Felix Klein]] played down the tension between synthetic and analytic methods:
::On the Antithesis between the Synthetic and the Analytic Method in Modern Geometry:
:The distinction between modern synthesis and modern analytic geometry must no longer be regarded as essential, inasmuch as both subject-matter and methods of reasoning have gradually taken a similar form in both. We choose therefore in the text as common designation of them both the term projective geometry. Although the synthetic method has more to do with space-perception and thereby imparts a rare charm to its first simple developments, the realm of space-perception is nevertheless not closed to the analytic method, and the formulae of analytic geometry can be looked upon as a precise and perspicuous statement of geometrical relations. On the other hand, the advantage to original research of a well formulated analysis should not be underestimated, - an advantage due to its moving, so to speak, in advance of the thought. But it should always be insisted that a mathematical subject is not to be considered exhausted until it has become intuitively evident, and the progress made by the aid of analysis is only a first, though a very important, step.<ref>Felix Klein (1872) Ralf Stephan translator (2006) [http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3161 "A comparative review of researches in geometry"]</ref>

The close axiomatic study of [[Euclidean geometry]] led to the construction of the [[Lambert quadrilateral]] and the [[Saccheri quadrilateral]]. These structures introduced the field of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] where Euclid's parallel axiom is denied. [[Gauss]], [[Bolyai]] and [[Lobachevski]] independently constructed [[hyperbolic geometry]], where parallel lines have an [[angle of parallelism]] that depends on their separation. This study became widely accessible through the [[Poincaré disc]] model where [[motion (geometry)|motion]]s are given by [[Möbius transformation]]s.

Another example concerns [[inversive geometry]] as advanced by [[Ludwig Immanuel Magnus]], which can be considered synthetic in spirit. The closely related operation of [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocation]] expresses analysis of the plane.

[[Karl von Staudt]] showed that algebraic axioms, such as [[commutativity]] and [[associativity]] of addition and multiplication, were in fact consequences of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of lines in [[geometric configuration]]s. [[David Hilbert]] showed<ref>[[David Hilbert]], 1980 (1899). ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17384/17384-pdf.pdf The Foundations of Geometry]'', 2nd edition, §22 Desargues Theorem, Chicago: Open Court</ref> that the [[Desargues configuration]] played a special role. Further work was done by [[Ruth Moufang]] and her students. The concepts have been one of the motivators of [[incidence geometry]].

When [[parallel lines]] are taken as primary, synthesis produces [[affine geometry]]. Though Euclidean geometry is both affine and [[metric geometry]], in general [[affine space]]s may be missing a metric. The extra flexibility thus afforded makes affine geometry appropriate for the study of [[spacetime]], as discussed in the [[affine geometry#History|history of affine geometry]].

In 1955 Herbert Busemann and Paul J. Kelley sounded a nostalgic note for synthetic geometry:
:Although reluctantly, geometers must admit that the beauty of synthetic geometry has lost its appeal for the new generation. The reasons are clear: not so long ago synthetic geometry was the only field in which the reasoning proceeded strictly from axioms, whereas this appeal — so fundamental to many mathematically interested people — is now made by many other fields.<ref>[[Herbert Busemann]] and Paul J. Kelly (1953) ''Projective Geometry and Projective Metrics'', Preface, page v, [[Academic Press]]</ref>

For example, college studies now include [[linear algebra]], [[topology]], and [[graph theory]] where the subject is developed from first principles, and propositions are deduced by [[elementary proof]]s. In an abstract sense, these subjects are also synthetic geometry.

Today's student of geometry has axioms other than Euclid's available: see [[Hilbert's axioms]] and [[Tarski's axioms]].

[[Ernst Kötter]] published a (German) report on ''"The development of synthetic geometry from [[Monge]] to Staudt (1847)"'';<ref>{{cite book| author=Ernst Kötter| title=Die Entwickelung der Synthetischen Geometrie von Monge bis auf Staudt (1847)| year=1901 |url=http://gdz-lucene.tc.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gcs/gcs?&action=pdf&metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005&divID=LOG_0035&pagesize=original&pdfTitlePage=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/pdftitle/?metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005%7C&targetFileName=PPN37721857X_0005_LOG_0035.pdf&}} (2012 Reprint as ISBN 1275932649)</ref>

==Proofs using synthetic geometry==

Synthetic proofs of geometric theorems make use of concepts such as equality of sides or angles and [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]] and [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] of triangles. Examples of such proofs can be found in the articles [[Butterfly theorem]], [[Angle bisector theorem]], [[Apollonius' theorem]], [[British flag theorem]], [[Ceva's theorem]], [[Equal incircles theorem]], [[Geometric mean theorem]], [[Heron's formula]], [[Isosceles triangle theorem]], [[Law of cosines]], and others that are linked to [[:Category:Theorems in plane geometry|here]].

==Computational synthetic geometry==
In conjunction with [[computational geometry]], a '''computational synthetic geometry''' has been founded, having close connection, for example, with [[matroid]] theory. [[Synthetic differential geometry]] is an application of [[topos]] theory to the foundations of [[differentiable manifold]] theory.
