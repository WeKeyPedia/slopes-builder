In [[mathematics]], '''convex geometry''' is the branch of [[geometry]] studying [[convex set]]s, mainly in [[Euclidean space]]. Convex sets occur naturally in many areas: [[computational geometry]], [[convex analysis]], [[discrete geometry]], [[functional analysis]], [[geometry of numbers]], [[integral geometry]], [[linear programming]], [[probability theory]], etc.

==Classification==
According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] MSC2010,<ref>[http://www.msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=MSC2010 Website of Mathematics Subject Classification MSC2010]</ref> the mathematical discipline ''Convex and Discrete Geometry'' includes three major branches:<ref>[http://www.msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=52-XX Mathematics Subject Classification MSC2010, entry 52 "Convex and discrete geometry"]</ref>
* general convexity
* polytopes and polyhedra
* discrete geometry

General convexity is further subdivided as follows:<ref>[http://www.msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=52Axx Mathematics Subject Classification MSC2010, entry 52A "General convexity"]</ref>  
*axiomatic and generalized convexity			
*convex sets without dimension restrictions 			
*convex sets in topological vector spaces  			
*convex sets in 2 dimensions (including convex curves) 		
*convex sets in 3 dimensions (including convex surfaces) 	
*convex sets in ''n'' dimensions (including convex hypersurfaces) 		
*finite-dimensional Banach spaces				
*random convex sets and integral geometry 
*asymptotic theory of convex bodies 
*approximation by convex sets 					
*variants of convex sets (star-shaped, (''m, n'')-convex, etc.) 		
*Helly-type theorems and geometric transversal theory		
*other problems of combinatorial convexity  			
*length, area, volume 						
*[[mixed volume]]s and related topics  			
*inequalities and extremum problems  		
*convex functions and convex programs 
*spherical and hyperbolic convexity  		

The term ''convex geometry'' is also used in [[combinatorics]] as the name for one of the abstract models of convex sets, one that is equivalent to [[antimatroid]]s.

==Historical note==
Convex geometry is a relatively young mathematical discipline. Although the first known contributions to convex geometry date back to antiquity and can be traced in the works of [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]], it became an  independent branch of mathematics at the turn of the 19th century, mainly due to the works of Hermann Brunn and [[Hermann Minkowski]] in dimensions two and three. A big part of their results was soon generalized to spaces of higher dimensions, and in 1934 [[Tommy Bonnesen|T. Bonnesen]] and [[Werner Fenchel|W. Fenchel]] gave a comprehensive survey of convex geometry in [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>n</sup>. Further development of convex geometry in the 20th century and its relations to numerous mathematical disciplines are summarized in the ''Handbook of convex geometry'' edited by P. M. Gruber and J. M. Wills.
