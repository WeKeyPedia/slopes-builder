[[Image:Möbius strip.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Möbius strip]]s, which have only one surface and one edge, are a kind of object studied in topology.]]

'''Topology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] τόπος, "place", and λόγος, "study") is the mathematical study of shapes and [[Topological space|topological spaces]]. It is an area of [[mathematics]] concerned with the  properties of space that are preserved under [[Continuous function|continuous]] deformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. This includes such properties as  [[connectedness]], [[Continuous function (topology)|continuity]] and [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]].

Topology developed as a field of study out of [[geometry]] and [[set theory]], through analysis of such concepts as space, dimension, and transformation.  Such ideas go back to [[Leibniz]], who in the 17th century envisioned the ''geometria situs'' (Greek-Latin for "geometry of place") and ''analysis situs'' (Greek-Latin for "picking apart of place").  The term ''topology'' was introduced by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a [[topological space]] was developed.  By the middle of the 20th century, topology had become a major branch of mathematics.

Topology has many subfields:
*'''[[General topology]]''' establishes the foundational aspects of topology and investigates properties of topological spaces and investigates concepts inherent to topological spaces. It includes [[point-set topology]], which is the foundational topology used in all other branches (including topics like [[compactness]] and [[connectedness]]).
*'''[[Algebraic topology]]''' tries to measure degrees of connectivity using algebraic constructs such as [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[homotopy groups]].
*'''[[Differential topology]]''' is the field dealing with [[differentiable function]]s on [[differentiable manifold]]s. It is closely related to [[differential geometry]] and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds.
*'''[[Geometric topology]]''' primarily studies [[manifold]]s and their embeddings (placements) in other manifolds. A particularly active area is '''[[low dimensional topology]]''', which studies manifolds of four or fewer dimensions. This includes '''[[knot theory]]''', the study of [[knot (mathematics)|mathematical knot]]s.

==History==
[[Image:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|left|240px|The [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] was a problem solved by Euler.]]

Topology began with the investigation of certain questions in geometry. [[Leonhard Euler]]'s 1736 paper on the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]<ref>Euler, Leonhard, [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E053.pdf Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis]</ref> is regarded as one of the first academic treatises in modern topology.

The term "Topologie" was introduced in German in 1847 by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] in ''Vorstudien zur Topologie'',<ref>Listing, Johann Benedict, "Vorstudien zur Topologie", Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, Göttingen, p.&nbsp;67, 1848</ref> who had used the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in print. The English form topology was first used in 1883 in Listing's obituary in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']]<ref>Tait, Peter Guthrie, "Johann Benedict Listing (obituary)", Nature *27*, 1 February 1883, pp. 316–317</ref> to distinguish "qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated". The term '''topologist''' in the sense of a specialist in topology was used in 1905 in the magazine ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, none of these uses corresponds exactly to the modern definition of topology.

Modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of [[set theory]], developed by [[Georg Cantor]] in the later part of the 19th century. In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, Cantor considered point sets in [[Euclidean space]] as part of his study of [[Fourier series]].

[[Henri Poincaré]] published ''[[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]]'' in 1895,<ref>Poincaré, Henri, "Analysis situs", Journal de l'École Polytechnique ser 2, 1 (1895) pp. 1–123</ref> introducing the concepts of [[homotopy]] and [[homology (mathematics)|homology]], which are now considered part of [[algebraic topology]].

Unifying the work on function spaces of Georg Cantor, [[Vito Volterra]], [[Cesare Arzelà]], [[Jacques Hadamard]], [[Giulio Ascoli]] and others, [[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced the [[metric space]] in 1906.<ref>Fréchet, Maurice, "Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel", PhD dissertation, 1906</ref> A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space. In 1914, [[Felix Hausdorff]] coined the term "topological space" and gave the definition for what is now called a [[Hausdorff space]].<ref>Hausdorff, Felix, "Grundzüge der Mengenlehre", Leipzig: Veit. In (Hausdorff Werke, II (2002), 91–576)</ref> Currently, a topological space is a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces, given in 1922 by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

For further developments, see [[point-set topology]] and [[algebraic topology]].

==Introduction==
Topology can be formally defined as "the study of qualitative properties of certain objects (called [[topological spaces]]) that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a certain kind of transformation (called a [[continuous maps|continuous map]]), especially those properties that are invariant under a certain kind of transformation (called [[homeomorphism]])."

Topology is also used to refer to a structure imposed upon a set ''X'', a structure that essentially 'characterizes' the set ''X'' as a [[topological space]] by taking proper care of properties such as [[limit of a sequence|convergence]], [[connectedness]] and [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]], upon transformation.

Topological spaces show up naturally in almost every branch of mathematics. This has made topology one of the great unifying ideas of mathematics.

The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the way they are put together. For example, the square and the circle have many properties in common: they are both one dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate the plane into two parts, the part inside and the part outside.

One of the first papers in topology was the demonstration, by [[Leonhard Euler]], that it was impossible to find a route through the town of Königsberg (now [[Kaliningrad]]) that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges, nor on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges are connected to which islands or riverbanks. This problem in introductory mathematics called ''[[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]'' led to the branch of mathematics known as [[graph theory]].

[[Image:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|240px|A continuous deformation (a type of [[homeomorphism]]) of a mug into a doughnut ([[torus]]) and back]]

Similarly, the [[hairy ball theorem]] of algebraic topology says that "one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a [[cowlick]]." This fact is immediately convincing to most people, even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem, that there is no nonvanishing continuous [[vector field|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]]. As with the ''Bridges of Königsberg'', the result does not depend on the shape of the sphere; it applies to any kind of smooth blob, as long as it has no holes.

To deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects, one must be clear about just what properties these problems ''do'' rely on. From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism. The impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges homeomorphic to those in Königsberg, and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space homeomorphic to a sphere.

Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut, since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle. 

Homeomorphism can be considered the most basic ''topological equivalence''. Another is [[homotopy equivalence]]. This is harder to describe without getting technical, but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from "squishing" some larger object.

An introductory [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] is to classify the uppercase letters of the [[Latin alphabet|English alphabet]] according to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence. The result depends partially on the font used. The figures use the [[sans-serif]] [[Myriad (font)|Myriad]] [[font]]. Homotopy equivalence is a rougher relationship than homeomorphism; a homotopy equivalence class can contain several homeomorphism classes. The simple case of homotopy equivalence described above can be used here to show two letters are homotopy equivalent. For example, O fits inside P and the tail of the P can be squished to the "hole" part.

Homeomorphism classes are:
*no holes,
*no holes three tails,
*no holes four tails,
*one hole no tail,
*one hole one tail,
*one hole two tails,
*two holes no tail, and
*a bar with four tails (the "bar" on the ''K'' is almost too short to see).

Homotopy classes are larger, because the tails can be squished down to a point. They are:
*one hole,
*two holes, and
*no holes.

To be sure that the letters are classified correctly, we need to show that two letters in the same class are equivalent and two letters in different classes are not equivalent. In the case of homeomorphism, this can be done by selecting points and showing their removal disconnects the letters differently. For example, X and Y are not homeomorphic because removing the center point of the X leaves four pieces; whatever point in Y corresponds to this point, its removal can leave at most three pieces. The case of homotopy equivalence is harder and requires a more elaborate argument showing an algebraic invariant, such as the [[fundamental group]], is different on the supposedly differing classes.

Letter topology has practical relevance in [[stencil]] [[typography]]. For instance, [[Braggadocio (typeface)|Braggadocio]] font stencils are made of one connected piece of material.

==Concepts==

===Topologies on Sets===
{{Main|Topological space}}

The term '''topology''' also refers to a specific mathematical idea which is central to the area of mathematics called topology. Informally, a topology is used to tell how elements of a set are related spatially to each other. The same set can have different topologies. For instance, the [[real line]], the [[complex plane]], and the [[Cantor set]] can be thought of as the same set with different topologies.

Formally, let ''X'' be a set and let ''τ'' be a [[ family of sets|family]] of subsets of ''X''. Then ''τ'' is called a ''topology on X'' if:

# Both the empty set and ''X'' are elements of ''τ''
# Any union of elements of ''τ'' is an element of ''τ''
# Any intersection of finitely many elements of ''τ'' is an element of ''τ''

If ''τ'' is a topology on ''X'', then the pair (''X'', ''τ'') is called a ''topological space''. The notation ''X<sub>τ</sub>'' may be used to denote a set ''X'' endowed with the particular topology ''τ''.

The members of ''τ'' are called ''[[open set]]s'' in ''X''. A subset of ''X'' is said to be [[closed set|closed]] if its complement is in ''τ'' (i.e., its complement is open). A subset of ''X'' may be open, closed, both ([[clopen set]]), or neither. The empty set and ''X'' itself are always both closed and open. An open set containing a point ''x'' is called a '[[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]]' of ''x''.

A set with a topology is called a [[topological space]].

===Continuous functions and homeomorphisms===
{{Main|Continuous function|homeomorphism}}
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] or map from one topological space to another is called ''continuous'' if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the [[real number]]s to the real numbers (both spaces with the Standard Topology), then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in [[calculus]]. If a continuous function is [[injective function|one-to-one]] and [[surjective function|onto]], and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a [[homeomorphism]] and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.

===Manifolds===
{{Main|Manifold}}
While topological spaces can be extremely varied and exotic, many areas of topology focus on the more familiar class of spaces known as manifolds. A '''manifold''' is a [[topological space]] that resembles [[Euclidean space]] near each point.  More precisely, each point of an ''n''-dimensional manifold has a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] that is [[homeomorphic]] to the Euclidean space of dimension ''n''.  [[Line (geometry)|Line]]s and [[circle]]s, but not [[Lemniscate|figure eights]], are one-dimensional manifolds.  Two-dimensional manifolds are also called [[surface]]s.  Examples include the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], the [[sphere]], and the [[torus]], which can all be realized in three dimensions, but also the [[Klein bottle]] and [[real projective plane]] which cannot.

==Topics==

===General topology===
{{Main|General topology}}
'''General topology''' is the branch of topology dealing with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology.<ref>Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.</ref><ref>Adams, Colin Conrad, and Robert David Franzosa. Introduction to topology: pure and applied. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008.</ref> It is the foundation of most other branches of topology, including [[differential topology]], [[geometric topology]], and [[algebraic topology]]. Another name for general topology is '''point-set topology'''.

The fundamental concepts in point-set topology are ''continuity'', ''compactness'', and ''connectedness''. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points; compact sets are those which can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size; and connected sets are sets which cannot be divided into two pieces which are far apart. The words 'nearby', 'arbitrarily small', and 'far apart' can all be made precise by using open sets, as described below. If we change the definition of 'open set', we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for 'open set' is called a ''topology''. A set with a topology is called a ''topological space''.

''Metric spaces'' are an important class of topological spaces where distances can be assigned a number called a ''metric''. Having a metric simplifies many proofs, and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces.

===Algebraic topology===
{{Main|Algebraic topology}}
'''Algebraic topology''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] that uses tools from [[abstract algebra]] to study [[topological space]]s.<ref>Allen Hatcher, [http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html ''Algebraic topology.''] (2002) Cambridge University Press, xii+544 pp.&nbsp;ISBN 0-521-79160-X and ISBN 0-521-79540-0.</ref> The basic goal is to find algebraic [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] that [[classification theorem|classify]] topological spaces [[up to]] [[homeomorphism]], though usually most classify up to [[Homotopy#Homotopy equivalence and null-homotopy|homotopy equivalence]].

The most important of these invariants are [[homotopy group]]s, [[homology (mathematics)|homology]], and [[cohomology]].

Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a [[free group]] is again a free group.

=== Differential topology===
{{Main|Differential topology}}
'''Differential topology''' is the field dealing with [[differentiable function]]s on [[differentiable manifold]]s.<ref>{{cite book | first = John M. | last = Lee | year = 2006 | title = Introduction to Smooth Manifolds | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 978-0-387-95448-6}}</ref> It is closely related to [[differential geometry]] and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds.

More specifically, differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a [[smooth structure]] on a manifold to be defined.  Smooth manifolds are 'softer' than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and [[Deformation theory|deformations]] that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and [[Riemannian curvature]] are [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold&mdash;that is, one can smoothly "flatten out" certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume.

=== Geometric topology ===
{{Main|Geometric topology}}

'''Geometric topology''' is a branch of topology that primarily focuses on low-dimensional manifolds (i.e. dimensions 2,3 and 4) and their interaction with geometry, but it also includes some higher-dimensional topology.<ref>{{cite web

<ref>R.B. Sher and R.J. Daverman (2002), ''Handbook of Geometric Topology'', North-Holland. ISBN 0-444-82432-4</ref> Some examples of topics in geometric topology are [[Orientable manifold|orientability]], [[handle decomposition]]s, [[local flatness]], and the planar and higher-dimensional [[Jordan-Schönflies theorem|Schönflies theorem]].

In high-dimensional topology, [[characteristic classes]] are a basic invariant, and [[surgery theory]] is a key theory.

Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the [[uniformization theorem]] in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive curvature/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the [[geometrization conjecture]] (now theorem) in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of 8 possible geometries.

2-dimensional topology can be studied as complex geometry in one variable (Riemann surfaces are complex curves) – by the uniformization theorem every conformal class of metrics is equivalent to a unique complex one, and 4-dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables (complex surfaces), though not every 4-manifold admits a complex structure.

===Generalizations===
Occasionally, one needs to use the tools of topology but a "set of points" is not available. In [[pointless topology]] one considers instead the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of open sets as the basic notion of the theory,<ref>[[Peter Johnstone (mathematician)|Johnstone, Peter T.]], 1983, "[http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.bams/1183550014 The point of pointless topology,]" ''Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 8(1)'': 41-53.</ref> while [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] are structures defined on arbitrary [[category theory|categories]] that allow the definition of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] on those categories, and with that the definition of general cohomology theories.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Artin | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Artin | title=Grothendieck topologies | publisher=Harvard University, Dept. of Mathematics | year=1962 | zbl=0208.48701 | location=Cambridge, MA }}</ref>

==Applications==

===Biology===

[[Knot theory]], a branch of topology, is used in biology to study the effects of certain enzymes on DNA. These enzymes cut, twist, and reconnect the DNA, causing knotting with observable effects such as slower electrophoresis.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Colin |last= Adams|author-link=Colin Adams (mathematician)|title=The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots |publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2004|isbn=0-8218-3678-1|ref=harv|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> Topology is also used in evolutionary biology to represent the relationship between phenotype and genotype.<ref name=bstadler2001>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519301924233#|title=The Topology of the Possible: Formal Spaces Underlying Patterns of Evolutionary Change|author=Barble M R Stadler et al|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=213|pages=241–274|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2001.2423}}</ref> Phenotypic forms which appear quite different can be separated by only a few mutations depending on how genetic changes map to phenotypic changes during development.

===Computer science===

[[Topological data analysis]] uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large scale structure of a set (for instance, determining if a cloud of points is spherical or [[torus|toroidal]]). The main method used by topological data analysis is:
# Replace a set of data points with a family of [[simplicial complex]]es, indexed by a proximity parameter.
# Analyse these topological complexes via [[algebraic topology]] — specifically, via the theory of [[persistent homology]].<ref name=carlsson2009>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf|title=Topology and data|author=Gunnar Carlsson|journal=BULLETIN (New Series) OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY|volume=46|issue=2|date=April 2009|pages=255–308|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-09-01249-X}}</ref>
# Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a [[Betti number]] which is called a '''barcode'''.<ref name=carlsson2009/>

===Physics===
In physics, topology is used in several areas such as quantum field theory and cosmology.

A '''topological quantum field theory''' (or '''topological field theory''' or '''TQFT''') is a [[quantum field theory]] which computes [[topological invariant]]s.

Although TQFTs were invented by physicists, they are also of mathematical interest, being related to, among other things, [[knot theory]] and the theory of [[four-manifold]]s in [[algebraic topology]], and to the theory of [[moduli spaces]] in [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Simon Donaldson|Donaldson]], [[Vaughan Jones|Jones]], [[Edward Witten|Witten]], and [[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]] have all won [[Fields Medal]]s for work related to topological field theory.

In cosmology, topology can be used to describe the overall shape of the universe.<ref>''The Shape of Space: How to Visualize Surfaces and Three-dimensional Manifolds'' 2nd ed (Marcel Dekker, 1985, ISBN 0-8247-7437-X)</ref> This area is known as [[spacetime topology]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Robotics ===
The various possible positions of a robot can be described by a [[manifold]] called [[configuration space]].<ref>John J. Craig, '''Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control''', 3rd Ed. Prentice-Hall, 2004</ref> In the area of [[motion planning]], one finds paths between two points in configuration space. These paths represent a motion of the robot's joints and other parts into the desired location and pose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
