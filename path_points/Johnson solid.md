[[Image:Elongated square gyrobicupola.png|thumb|right|The [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (''J''<sub>37</sub>), a Johnson solid]]
[[Image:Stella octangula.png|160px|thumb|This [[Stella octangula|24 equilateral triangle]] example is not a Johnson solid because it is not convex. (This is actually a [[stellation]], the only one possible for the [[octahedron]].)]]
[[Image:Partial cubic honeycomb.png|160px|thumb|This 24-square example is not a Johnson solid because it is not strictly convex (has 180° [[dihedral angle]]s.)]]

In [[geometry]], a '''Johnson solid''' is a strictly [[convex polyhedron]], each face of which is a [[regular polygon]], but which is not [[uniform polyhedron|uniform]], i.e., not a [[Platonic solid]], [[Archimedean solid]], [[prism (geometry)|prism]] or [[antiprism]]. There is no requirement that each face must be the same polygon, or that the same polygons join around each vertex. An example of a Johnson solid is the square-based [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] with [[equilateral]] sides ([[square pyramid|''J''<sub>1</sub>]]); it has 1 square face and 4 triangular faces.

As in any strictly convex solid, at least three faces meet at every vertex, and the total of their angles is less than 360 degrees. Since a regular polygon has angles at least 60 degrees, it follows that at most five faces meet at any vertex. The [[pentagonal pyramid]] (''J''<sub>2</sub>) is an example that actually has a degree-5 vertex.

Although there is no obvious restriction that any given regular polygon cannot be a face of a Johnson solid, it turns out that the faces of Johnson solids always have 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 sides.

In 1966, [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] published a list which included all 92 solids, and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only 92, but he did conjecture that there were no others. [[Victor Zalgaller]] in 1969 proved that Johnson's list was complete.

Of the Johnson solids, the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (''J''<sub>37</sub>), also called the pseudorhombicuboctahedron,<ref>http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pseudo-rhombicuboctahedra.html</ref> is unique in being locally vertex-uniform: there are 4 faces at each vertex, and their arrangement is always the same: 3 squares and 1 triangle. However, it is not vertex-transitive, as it has different isometry at different vertices, making it a Johnson solid rather than an [[Archimedean solid]].

== Names ==
The names are listed below and are more descriptive than they sound. Most of the Johnson solids can be constructed from the first few ([[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], [[cupola (geometry)|cupola]]e, and [[rotunda (geometry)|rotunda]]), together with the [[Platonic solid|Platonic]] and [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] solids, [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s, and [[antiprism]]s.

*'''Bi-''' means that two copies of the solid in question are joined base-to-base. For cupolae and rotundae, they can be joined so that like faces ('''ortho-''') or unlike faces ('''gyro-''') meet. In this nomenclature, an [[octahedron]] would be a ''square bipyramid'', a [[cuboctahedron]] would be a ''triangular gyrobicupola'', and an [[icosidodecahedron]] would be a ''pentagonal gyrobirotunda''.
*'''Elongated''' means that a prism has been joined to the base of the solid in question or between the bases of the solids in question. A [[rhombicuboctahedron]] would be an ''elongated square orthobicupola''.
*'''Gyroelongated''' means that an [[antiprism]] has been joined to the base of the solid in question or between the bases of the solids in question.  An [[icosahedron]] would be a ''gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid''.
*'''Augmented''' means that a pyramid or cupola has been joined to a face of the solid in question.
*'''Diminished''' means that a pyramid or cupola has been removed from the solid in question.
*'''[[gyration|Gyrate]]''' means that a cupola on the solid in question has been rotated so that different edges match up, as in the difference between ortho- and gyrobicupolae.

The last three operations — ''augmentation'', ''diminution'', and ''gyration'' — can be performed more than once on a large enough solid.  We add ''bi-'' to the name of the operation to indicate that it has been performed twice.  (A ''bigyrate'' solid has had two of its cupolae rotated.)  We add ''tri-'' to indicate that it has been performed three times.  (A ''tridiminished'' solid has had three of its pyramids or cupolae removed.)

Sometimes, ''bi-'' alone is not specific enough.  We must distinguish between a solid that has had two parallel faces altered and one that has had two oblique faces altered.  When the faces altered are parallel, we add ''para-'' to the name of the operation.  (A ''parabiaugmented'' solid has had two parallel faces augmented.)  When they are not, we add ''meta-'' to the name of the operation.  (A ''metabiaugmented'' solid has had 2 oblique faces augmented.)

The last few Johnson solids have names based on certain polygon complexes that they are assembled from. These names are defined by Johnson as follows:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/johnson-info.html | title = Johnson Solids | accessdate = 5 February 2014 | author = George Hart (quoting Johnson) | website = Virtual Polyhedra | year = 1996}}</ref>

:If we define a ''lune'' as a complex of two triangles attached to opposite sides of a square, the prefix ''spheno''- refers to a wedgelike complex formed by two adjacent lunes.  The prefix ''dispheno''- denotes two such complexes, while ''hebespheno''- indicates a blunter complex of two lunes separated by a third lune.  The suffix -''corona'' refers to a crownlike complex of eight triangles, and -''megacorona'', to a larger such complex of 12 triangles.  The suffix -''cingulum'' indicates a belt of 12 triangles.

=== Pyramids ===
The first two Johnson solids, J1 and J2, are [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]s. The ''triangular pyramid'' is the regular [[tetrahedron]], so it is not a Johnson solid.

=== Elongated and gyroelongated pyramids===

The next five Johnson solids are elongated and gyroelongated pyramids. These represent the composite or augmentation of two polyhedra.  In the gyroelongated triangular pyramid, three pairs of adjacent triangles are coplanar and form non-square parallelograms, so it is not a Johnson solid.

=== Snub antiprisms ===
The [[snub (geometry)|snub]] [[antiprism]]s can be constructed as an alternation of a truncated antiprism. Two are Johnson solids, one is a regular, and the rest can not be construcated with regular triangles.
