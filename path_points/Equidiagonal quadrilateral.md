[[File:Equidiagonal quadrilateral.svg|thumb|300px|An  equidiagonal quadrilateral, showing its equal diagonals, Varignon rhombus, and perpendicular bimedians]]
In [[Euclidean geometry]], an '''equidiagonal quadrilateral''' is a [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] whose two [[diagonal]]s have equal length. Equidiagonal quadrilaterals were important in ancient [[Indian mathematics]], where quadrilaterals were classified first according to whether they were equidiagonal and then into more specialized types.<ref>{{citation

==Special cases==
Examples of equidiagonal quadrilaterals include the [[isosceles trapezoid]]s, [[rectangle]]s and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s.

Among all quadrilaterals, the shape that has the greatest ratio of its [[perimeter]] to its [[diameter]] is an equidiagonal [[kite (geometry)|kite]] with angles π/3, 5π/12, 5π/6, and 5π/12.<ref>{{citation |first=D.G. |last=Ball |title=A generalisation of π |journal=Mathematical Gazette |volume=57 |issue=402 |year=1973 |pages=298–303 |doi=10.2307/3616052}}; {{citation |first1=David |last1= Griffiths |first2=David |last2=Culpin |title=Pi-optimal polygons |journal=Mathematical Gazette |volume=59 |issue=409 |year=1975 |pages=165–175 |doi=10.2307/3617699}}.</ref>

==Characterizations==
A convex quadrilateral is equidiagonal if and only if its [[Varignon parallelogram]], the parallelogram formed by the midpoints of its sides, is a [[rhombus]]. An equivalent condition is that the [[Quadrilateral#Special line segments|bimedian]]s of the quadrilateral  (the diagonals of the Varignon parallelogram) are [[perpendicular]].<ref name="adventures"/>

A convex quadrilateral with diagonal lengths <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> and bimedian lengths <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> is equidiagonal if and only if<ref name=J2014/>{{rp|Prop.1}}

:<math>pq=m^2+n^2.</math>

==Area==
The [[area]] ''K'' of an equidiagonal quadrilateral can easily be calculated if the length of the [[Quadrilateral#Special line segments|bimedian]]s ''m'' and ''n'' are known. A quadrilateral is equidiagonal if and only if<ref name=Josefsson>Josefsson, Martin, [http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2013volume13/FG201304.pdf "Five Proofs of an Area Characterization of Rectangles"], ''Forum Geometricorum'' 13 (2013) 17–21.</ref>{{rp|p.19}} <ref name=J2014>Josefsson, Martin, "Properties of equidiagonal quadrilaterals",
''Forum Geometricorum'', 14 (2014), 129-144.  [http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2014volume14/FG201412index.html] </ref>{{rp|Corollary 4}}

:<math>\displaystyle K=mn.</math>

This is a direct consequence of the fact that the area of a convex quadrilateral is twice the area of its Varignon parallelogram and that the diagonals in this parallelogram are the bimedians of the quadrilateral. Using the formulas for the [[Quadrilateral#Bimedians|lengths of the bimedians]], the area can also be expressed in terms of the sides ''a, b, c, d'' of the equidiagonal quadrilateral and the distance ''x'' between the [[midpoint]]s of the diagonals as<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p.19}}
:<math>K=\tfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{(2(a^2+c^2)-4x^2)(2(b^2+d^2)-4x^2)}.</math>

Other area formulas may be obtained from setting ''p'' = ''q'' in the formulas for the [[Quadrilateral#Area of a convex quadrilateral|area of a convex quadrilateral]].

==Relation to other types of quadrilaterals==
A [[parallelogram]] is equidiagonal if and only if it is a rectangle,<ref>{{citation

There is a [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] between equidiagonal quadrilaterals and [[orthodiagonal quadrilateral]]s: a quadrilateral is equidiagonal if and only if its Varignon parallelogram is orthodiagonal (a rhombus), and the quadrilateral is orthodiagonal if and only if its Varignon parallelogram is equidiagonal (a rectangle).<ref name="adventures">{{citation

Quadrilaterals that are both orthodiagonal and equidiagonal, and in which the diagonals are at least as long as all of the quadrilateral's sides, have the maximum area for their diameter among all quadrilaterals, solving the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 case of the [[biggest little polygon]] problem. The square is one such quadrilateral, but there are infinitely many others. Equidiagonal, orthodiagonal quadrilaterals have been referred to as ''midsquare quadrilaterals'' 
<ref name=J2014/>{{rp|p. 137}} because they are the only ones for which the [[Varignon parallelogram]] (with vertices at the midpoints of the quadrilateral's sides) is a square. Such a quadrilateral, with successive sides ''a, b, c, d'', has area<ref name=J2014/>{{rp|Thm. 16}}
