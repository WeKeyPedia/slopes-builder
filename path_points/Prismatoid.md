In [[geometry]], a '''prismatoid''' is a [[polyhedron]] where all [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] lie in two parallel planes.  (If both planes have the same number of vertices, 
and the lateral faces are either [[parallelogram]]s or [[trapezoid]]s, it is called a '''prismoid'''.)

If the areas of the two parallel faces are A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>, the cross-sectional area of the intersection of the prismatoid with a plane midway between the two parallel faces is A<sub>2</sub>, and the height (the distance between the two parallel faces) is h, then the [[volume]] of the prismatoid is given by <math>V = \frac{h(A_1 + 4A_2 + A_3)}{6}</math> or <math>V = \frac{nh(a^2+4b^2+c^2)}{24\tan (180/n)}</math>(This formula follows immediately by [[integral|integrating]] the area parallel to the two planes of vertices by [[Simpson's rule]], since that rule is exact for integration of [[polynomial]]s of degree up to 3, and in this case the area is at most a [[quadratic function]] in the height.)

Families of prismatoids include:

* [[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramids]], where one plane contains only a single point;
* [[Wedge (geometry)|Wedges]], where one plane contains only two points;
* [[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]], where the polygons in each plane are congruent and joined by rectangles or parallelograms;
* [[Antiprism]]s, where the polygons in each plane are congruent and joined by an alternating strip of triangles;
* [[Crossed antiprism]]s;
* [[cupola (geometry)|Cupolae]], where the polygon in one plane contains twice as many points as the other and is joined to it by alternating triangles and rectangles;
* [[Frustum|Frusta]] obtained by [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] of a pyramid;
* [[Quadrilateral]]-faced [[Hexahedron|hexahedral]] prismatoids:
*# [[Parallelepiped]]s - six [[parallelogram]] faces
*# [[Rhombohedron]]s - six [[rhombus]] faces
*# [[Trigonal trapezohedron|Trigonal trapezohedra]] - six congruent rhombus faces
*# [[Cuboid]]s - six rectangular faces
*# [[frustum|Quadrilateral frusta]] - an [[Apex (geometry)|apex]]-[[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] [[square pyramid]]
*# [[Cube]]s - six square faces

== Higher dimensions ==

In general a [[polytope]] is prismatoidal if its vertices exist in two [[hyperplane]]s. For example in 4-dimensions, two polyhedra can be placed in 2 parallel 3-spaces, and connected with polyhedral sides.
