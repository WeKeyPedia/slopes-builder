In [[mathematics]], a '''Klein geometry''' is a type of [[geometry]] motivated by [[Felix Klein]] in his influential [[Erlangen program]]. More specifically, it is a [[homogeneous space]] ''X'' together with a [[group action|transitive action]] on ''X'' by a [[Lie group]] ''G'', which acts as the [[symmetry group]] of the geometry.

For background and motivation see the article on the [[Erlangen program]].

==Formal definition==
A '''Klein geometry''' is a pair {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} where ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and ''H'' is a [[closed set|closed]] [[Lie subgroup]] of ''G'' such that the (left) [[coset space]] ''G''/''H'' is [[connected space|connected]]. The group ''G'' is called the '''principal group''' of the geometry and ''G''/''H'' is called the '''space''' of the geometry (or, by an abuse of terminology, simply the ''Klein geometry''). The space {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''/''H''}} of a Klein geometry is a [[smooth manifold]] of dimension
:dim ''X'' = dim ''G'' − dim ''H''.

There is a natural smooth [[group action|left action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' given by
:<math>g.(aH) = (ga)H.</math>
Clearly, this action is transitive (take {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}}), so that one may then regard ''X'' as a [[homogeneous space]] for the action of ''G''. The [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of the identity coset {{nowrap|''H'' ∈ ''X''}} is precisely the group ''H''.

Given any connected smooth manifold ''X'' and a smooth transitive action by a Lie group ''G'' on ''X'', we can construct an associated Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} by fixing a basepoint ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''X'' and letting ''H'' be the stabilizer subgroup of ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''G''. The group ''H'' is necessarily a closed subgroup of ''G'' and ''X'' is naturally [[diffeomorphic]] to ''G''/''H''.

Two Klein geometries {{nowrap|(''G''<sub>1</sub>, ''H''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|(''G''<sub>2</sub>, ''H''<sub>2</sub>)}} are '''geometrically isomorphic''' if there is a [[Lie group isomorphism]] {{nowrap|''φ'' : ''G''<sub>1</sub> → ''G''<sub>2</sub>}} so that {{nowrap|1=''φ''(''H''<sub>1</sub>) = ''H''<sub>2</sub>}}. In particular, if ''φ''  is [[conjugacy class|conjugation]] by an element {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}, we see that {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} and {{nowrap|(''G'', ''gHg''<sup>−1</sup>)}} are isomorphic. The Klein geometry associated to a homogeneous space ''X'' is then unique up to isomorphism (i.e. it is independent of the chosen basepoint ''x''<sub>0</sub>).

==Bundle description==
Given a Lie group ''G'' and closed subgroup ''H'', there is natural [[group action|right action]] of ''H'' on ''G'' given by right multiplication.  This action is both free and [[proper action|proper]]. The [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] are simply the left [[coset]]s of ''H'' in ''G''. One concludes that ''G'' has the structure of a smooth [[principal bundle|principal ''H''-bundle]] over the left coset space ''G''/''H'':
:<math>H\to G\to G/H .</math>

==Types of Klein geometries==

===Effective geometries===
The action of ''G'' on {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''/''H''}} need not be effective. The '''kernel''' of a Klein geometry is defined to be the kernel of the action of ''G'' on ''X''. It is given by
:<math>K = \{k \in G : g^{-1}kg \in H\;\;\forall g \in G\}.</math>
The kernel ''K'' may also be described as the [[core (group)|core]] of ''H'' in ''G'' (i.e. the largest subgroup of ''H'' that is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in ''G''). It is the group generated by all the normal subgroups of ''G'' that lie in ''H''.

A Klein geometry is said to be '''effective''' if {{nowrap|1=''K'' = 1}} and '''locally effective''' if ''K'' is [[discrete group|discrete]]. If {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is a Klein geometry with kernel ''K'', then {{nowrap|(''G''/''K'', ''H''/''K'')}} is an effective Klein geometry canonically associated to {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}}.

===Geometrically oriented geometries===
A Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is '''geometrically oriented''' if ''G'' is [[connected space|connected]]. (This does ''not'' imply that ''G''/''H'' is an [[orientability|oriented manifold]]). If ''H'' is connected it follows that ''G'' is also connected (this is because ''G''/''H'' is assumed to be connected, and {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G''/''H''}} is a [[fibration]]).

Given any Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}}, there is a geometrically oriented geometry canonically associated to {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} with the same base space ''G''/''H''. This is the geometry {{nowrap|(''G''<sub>0</sub>, ''G''<sub>0</sub> ∩ ''H'')}} where ''G''<sub>0</sub> is the [[identity component]] of ''G''. Note that {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''G''<sub>0</sub> ''H''}}.

===Reductive geometries===
A Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is said to be '''reductive''' and ''G''/''H'' a '''reductive homogeneous space''' if the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\mathfrak h</math> of ''H'' has an ''H''-invariant complement in <math>\mathfrak g</math>.
