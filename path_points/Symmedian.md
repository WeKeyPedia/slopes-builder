[[Image:symmedians.png|thumb|300px|A triangle with medians (blue), angle bisectors (green) and symmedians (red). The symmedians intersect in the symmedian point K, the angle bisectors in the [[incenter]] I and the medians in the [[centroid]] G.]]
In [[geometry]], '''symmedians''' are three particular [[geometry|geometrical]] [[straight line|lines]] associated with every [[triangle]]. They are constructed by taking a [[Median (geometry)|median]] of the triangle (a line connecting a [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] with the [[midpoint]] of the opposite side), and reflecting the line over the corresponding [[angle bisector]] (the line through the same vertex that divides the angle there in half). The angle formed by the symmedian and the angle bisector has the same measure as the angle between the median and the angle bisector, but it is on the other side of the angle bisector.

The three symmedians meet at a [[triangle center]] called the '''symmedian point'''. [[Ross Honsberger]] called its existence "one of the crown jewels of modern geometry".<ref name="h"/>

==Isogonality==
Many times in geometry, if we take three special lines through the vertices of a triangle, or ''[[cevian]]s'', then their reflections about the corresponding angle bisectors, called ''isogonal lines'', will also have interesting properties. For instance, if three cevians of a triangle intersect at a point P, then their isogonal lines also intersect at a point, called the [[isogonal conjugate]] of P.

The symmedians illustrate this fact. 
* In the diagram, the medians (in blue) intersect at the [[centroid]] G.
* Because the symmedians (in red) are isogonal to the medians, the symmedians also intersect at a single point, K. 
This point is called the triangle's '''symmedian point''', or alternatively the '''Lemoine point''' or '''Grebe point'''.

The green lines are the angle bisectors; the symmedians and medians are symmetric about the angle bisectors (hence the name "symmedian.")

==Symmedian point==
In the [[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]] the symmedian point appears as the sixth point, X(6).<ref name="etc">[http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETC.html Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers], accessed 2014-11-06.</ref> It lies in the open [[orthocentroidal disk]] punctured at its own center, and could be any point therein.<ref>{{citation|first1=Christopher J.|last1=Bradley|first2=Geoff C.|last2=Smith|title=The locations of triangle centers|journal=Forum Geometricorum|volume=6|year=2006|pages=57–70|url=http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2006volume6/FG200607index.html}}.</ref>

The symmedian point of a triangle with side lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' has homogeneous [[trilinear coordinates]] [''a'' : ''b'' : ''c''].<ref name="etc"/>

The [[Gergonne point]] of a triangle is the same as the symmedian point of the triangle's [[contact triangle]].<ref>{{citation

==History==

The French mathematician [[Émile Lemoine]] proved the existence of the symmedian point in 1873, and [[Ernst Wilhelm Grebe]] published a paper on it 1847. [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huilier]] had also noted the point in 1809.<ref name="h">{{citation|first=Ross|last=Honsberger|authorlink=Ross Honsberger|contribution=Chapter 7: The Symmedian Point|title=Episodes in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Euclidean Geometry|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|location=Washington, D.C.|year=1995}}.</ref>
