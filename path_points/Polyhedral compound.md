A '''polyhedral compound''' is a figure that is composed of several polyhedra sharing a common centre.  They are the three-dimensional analogs of [[star polygon#Regular compounds|polygonal compound]]s such as the [[hexagram]].

The outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a [[convex polyhedron]] called the [[convex hull]]. The compound is a [[facetting]] of the convex hull.

Another convex polyhedron is formed by the small central space common to all members of the compound. This polyhedron can be used as the '''core''' for a set of [[stellation]]s.

== Regular compounds ==

A regular polyhedron compound can be defined as a compound which, like a regular polyhedron, is [[vertex-transitive]], [[edge-transitive]], and [[face-transitive]]. There are five regular compounds of polyhedra.

|}

Best known is the compound of two [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], often called the [[stella octangula]], a name given to it by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]].  The vertices of the two tetrahedra define a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]] and the intersection of the two an [[octahedron]], which shares the same face-planes as the compound.  Thus it is a [[stellation]] of the octahedron, and in fact, the only finite stellation thereof.

The stella octangula can also be regarded as a [[#Dual-regular compounds|dual-regular compound]].

The [[compound of five tetrahedra]] comes in two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorph]]ic versions, which together make up the compound of 10 tetrahedra.  Each of the tetrahedral compounds is self-dual, and the compound of 5 cubes is dual to the compound of 5 octahedra.

== Dual compounds ==

A '''dual''' compound is composed of a polyhedron and its dual, arranged reciprocally about a common intersphere or midsphere, such that the edge of one polyhedron intersects the dual edge of the dual polyhedron. There are five such compounds of the regular polyhedra.

The tetrahedron is self-dual, so the dual compound of a tetrahedron with its [[dual polyhedron]] is also the regular [[Stella octangula]].

The cube-octahedron and dodecahedron-icosahedron dual compounds are the first stellations of the [[cuboctahedron]] and [[icosidodecahedron]], respectively.

The compound of the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great dodecahedron]] looks outwardly the same as the small stellated dodecahedron, because the great dodecahedron is completely contained inside. For this reason, the image shown above shows the small stellated dodecahedron in wireframe.

== Uniform compounds ==
{{main|Uniform polyhedron compound}}

In 1976 John Skilling published ''Uniform Compounds of Uniform Polyhedra'' which enumerated 75 compounds (including 6 as infinite [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] sets of compounds, #20-#25) made from uniform polyhedra with rotational symmetry. (Every vertex is [[vertex-transitive]] and every vertex is transitive with every other vertex.) This list includes the five regular compounds above. [http://www.interocitors.com/polyhedra/UCs/UniformCompounds.html]

The 75 uniform compounds are listed in the Table below. Most are shown singularly colored by each polyhedron element. Some chiral pairs of face groups are colored by symmetry of the faces within each polyhedron.

* [[Compound of three octahedra]]
* [[Compound of four cubes]]

Two polyhedra that are compounds but have their elements rigidly locked into place are the [[small complex icosidodecahedron]] (compound of [[icosahedron]] and [[great dodecahedron]]) and the [[great complex icosidodecahedron]] (compound of [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great icosahedron]]). If the definition of a [[uniform polyhedron]] is generalised they are uniform.

The section for entianomorphic pairs in Skilling's list does not contain the compound of two [[great snub dodecicosidodecahedron|great snub dodecicosidodecahedra]], as the [[pentagram (geometry)|pentagram]] faces would coincide. Removing the coincident faces results in the [[compound of twenty octahedra]].

==Group theory==
In terms of [[group theory]], if ''G'' is the symmetry group of a polyhedral compound, and the group [[acts transitively]] on the polyhedra (so that each polyhedron can be sent to any of the others, as in uniform compounds), then if ''H'' is the [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of a single chosen polyhedron, the polyhedra can be identified with the [[orbit space]] ''G''/''H'' – the coset ''gH'' corresponds to which polyhedron ''g'' sends the chosen polyhedron to.
