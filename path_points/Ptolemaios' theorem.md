[[Image:Ptolemy Theorem.svg|right|thumb|Ptolemy's theorem is a relation among these lengths in a cyclic quadrilateral.]]
In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''Ptolemy's theorem''' is a relation between the four sides and two diagonals of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (a quadrilateral whose [[Vertex_(geometry)#Of_a_polytope|vertices]] lie on a common circle).  The theorem is named after the [[Roman Greece|Greek]] [[astronomy|astronomer]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Ptolemy]] (Claudius Ptolemaeus).<ref>C. Ptolemy, ''Almagest'', Book 1, Chapter 10.</ref>  Ptolemy used the theorem as an aid to creating [[Ptolemy's table of chords|his table of chords]], a trigonometric table that he applied to astronomy.

If the quadrilateral is given with its four vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' in order, then the theorem states that: 

: <math>|\overline{AC}|\cdot |\overline{BD}|=|\overline{AB}|\cdot |\overline{CD}|+|\overline{BC}|\cdot |\overline{AD}|</math>

where the vertical lines denote the lengths of the line segments between the named vertices.

This relation may be verbally expressed as follows: 

:''If a quadrilateral is inscribable in a circle then the product of the measures of its diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the measures of the pairs of opposite sides.''

Moreover, the [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] of Ptolemy's theorem is also true:

:''In a quadrilateral, if the sum of the products of its two pairs of opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals, then the quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle.''

==Examples==

===Equilateral triangle===
[[Image:Ptolemy Equilateral.svg|right|thumb|Equilateral triangle]] 

Ptolemy's Theorem yields as a corollary a pretty theorem<ref name="wilson">[http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt725/Ptolemy/Ptolemy.html Wilson, Jim. "Ptolemy's Theorem."] link verified 2009-04-08</ref> regarding an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle.

'''Given''' An equilateral triangle inscribed on a circle and a point on the circle.

The distance from the point to the most distant vertex of the triangle is the sum of the distances from the point to the two nearer vertices.

'''Proof:''' Follows immediately from Ptolemy's theorem:

:<math>
qs=ps+rs\Rightarrow q=p+r.
</math>

===Square===

Any [[Square (geometry)|square]] can be inscribed in a circle whose center is the center of the square. If the common length of its four sides is equal to <math>a</math> then the length of the diagonal is equal to <math>a\sqrt{2}</math> according to the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and the relation obviously holds.

===Rectangle===
[[Image:Ptolemy Rectangle.svg|right|thumb|Pythagoras' theorem: ''"manifestum est"'': Copernicus]]
More generally, if the quadrilateral is a [[rectangle]] with sides a and b and diagonal d then Ptolemy's theorem reduces to the Pythagorean theorem. In this case the center of the circle coincides with the point of intersection of the diagonals. The product of the diagonals is then d<sup>2</sup>, the right hand side of Ptolemy's relation is the sum ''a''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''<sup>2</sup>.

Copernicus − who used Ptolemy's theorem extensively in his trigonometrical work − refers to this result as a 'Porism' or self-evident corollary:

:''Furthermore it is clear ('''manifestum est''') that when the chord subtending an arc has been given, that chord too can be found which subtends the rest of the semicircle.''<ref>[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&db_key=AST&page_ind=36&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium: Page 37]. See last two lines of this page. Copernicus refers to Ptolemy's theorem as [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&db_key=AST&page_ind=37&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES "Theorema Secundum".]</ref>

===Pentagon===
[[Image:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|right|thumb|The [[golden ratio]] follows from this application of Ptolemy's theorem]]
A more interesting example is the relation between the length ''a'' of the side and the (common) length ''b'' of the 5 chords in a regular pentagon. In this case the relation reads ''b''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''ab'' which yields the [[golden ratio]]
 
:<math>\varphi = {b \over a} = {{1+\sqrt{5}}\over 2}.</math> <ref>[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII8.html Proposition 8] in Book XIII of [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/Euclid.html Euclid's Elements] proves by similar triangles the same result: namely that length a (the side of the pentagon) divides length b (joining alternate vertices of the pentagon) in "mean and extreme ratio".</ref>

===Side of decagon===
[[Image:Ptolemy Pentagon2.svg|right|thumb|Side of the inscribed decagon]]
If now diameter AF is drawn bisecting DC so that DF and CF are sides c of an inscribed decagon, Ptolemy's Theorem can again be applied – this time to cyclic quadrilateral ADFC with diameter ''d'' as one of its diagonals:

:<math>ad=2bc\;</math>

:<math>\Rightarrow ad=2\varphi ac</math> where <math>\varphi</math> is the golden ratio.
:<math>\Rightarrow c=\frac{d}{2\varphi}.</math><ref>And in analogous fashion [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII9.html Proposition 9] in Book XIII of [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/Euclid.html Euclid's Elements] proves by similar triangles that length c (the side of the decagon) divides the radius in "mean and extreme ratio".</ref>

whence the side of the inscribed decagon is obtained in terms of the circle diameter. Pythagoras' Theorem applied to right triangle AFD then yields "b" in terms of the diameter and "a" the side of the pentagon <ref>An interesting article on the construction of a regular pentagon and determination of side length can be found at the following reference [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/pentagon.shtml]</ref> is thereafter calculated as
::<math>a=\frac {b} {\varphi}=b(\varphi-1).\ </math>

As [[Copernicus]] (following Ptolemy) wrote, 

:''"The diameter of a circle being given, the sides of the triangle, tetragon, pentagon, hexagon and decagon, which the same circle circumscribes, are also given."''<ref>[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&db_key=AST&page_ind=36&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES  De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium: Liber Primus: Theorema Primum]</ref>

==Proofs==
===Proof by Similarity of Triangles===
[[Image:Ptolemy's theorem.svg|thumb|400px|Constructions for a proof of Ptolemy's theorem]]
Let ABCD be a [[cyclic quadrilateral]].
On the [[chord (geometry)|chord]] BC, the [[inscribed angle]]s ∠BAC = ∠BDC, and on AB, ∠ADB = ∠ACB.
Construct K on AC such that ∠ABK = ∠CBD; since ∠ABK + ∠CBK = ∠ABC = ∠CBD + ∠ABD, ∠CBK = ∠ABD.

Now, by common angles △ABK is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to △DBC, and likewise △ABD is similar △KBC.
Thus AK/AB = CD/BD, and CK/BC = DA/BD;
equivalently, AK·BD = AB·CD, and CK·BD = BC·DA.
By adding two equalities we have AK·BD + CK·BD = AB·CD + BC·DA, and factorizing this gives (AK+CK)·BD = AB·CD + BC·DA.
But AK+CK = AC, so AC·BD = AB·CD + BC·DA, [[Q.E.D.]]<ref>{{citation|title=Charming Proofs: A Journey Into Elegant Mathematics|volume=42|series=Dolciani Mathematical Expositions|first1=Claudi|last1=Alsina|first2=Roger B.|last2=Nelsen|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=2010|isbn=9780883853481|page=112|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mIT5-BN_L0oC&pg=PA112}}.</ref>

The proof as written is only valid for [[simple polygon|simple]] cyclic quadrilaterals. If the quadrilateral is self-crossing then K will be located outside the line segment AC. But in this case, AK&minus;CK=±AC, giving the expected result.

===Proof by Trigonometric Identities===
Let the inscribed angles subtended by <math>AB</math>, <math>BC</math> and <math>CD</math> are, respectively, <math>\alpha</math>, <math>\beta</math> and <math>\gamma</math>, and the radius of the circle is <math>R</math>, then we have <math>AB=2R\sin\alpha</math>, <math>BC=2R\sin\beta</math>, <math>CD=2R\sin\gamma</math>, <math>AD=2R\sin(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)</math>, <math>AC=2R\sin(\alpha+\beta)</math> and <math>BD=2R\sin(\beta+\gamma)</math>, and the original equality to be proved is transformed to

:<math>\sin(\alpha+\beta)\sin(\beta+\gamma)=\sin\alpha\sin\gamma+\sin\beta\sin(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)</math>

from which the factor <math>4R^2</math> has disappeared by dividing both sides of the equation by it.

Now by using the sum-to-product identities, <math>\sin(x+y)=\sin{x}\cos{y}+\cos{x}\sin{y}</math> and <math>\cos(x+y)=\cos{x}\cos{y}-\sin{x}\sin{y}</math>, it is trivial to show that both sides of the above equation are equal to <math>\sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\beta\cos\gamma+\sin\alpha\cos^2\beta\sin\gamma+\cos\alpha\sin^2\beta\cos\gamma+\cos\alpha\sin\beta\cos\beta\sin\gamma</math>. [[Q.E.D.]]

==Corollaries==

[[Image:Corollary 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Corollary 1: Pythagoras' Theorem]]

In the case of a circle of unit diameter the sides <math>S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4\;</math> of any cyclic quadrilateral ABCD  are numerically equal to the sines of the angles <math>\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3\,</math> and <math>\theta_4\,</math> which they subtend. Similarly the diagonals are equal to the sine of  the sum of  whichever '''pair'''  of angles they subtend.  We may then write Ptolemy's Theorem in the following trigonometric form:

:<math>\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)\;</math>

Applying certain conditions to the subtended angles <math>\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3\,</math> and <math>\theta_4\,</math>  it is possible to derive a number of important corollaries using the above as our starting point.  In what follows it is important to bear in mind that the sum of angles <math>\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3+\theta_4=180^\circ\,</math>.

===Corollary 1.  Pythagoras' theorem===

Let <math>\theta_1=\theta_3\;</math> and <math>\theta_2=\theta_4\;</math>.  Then  <math>\theta_1+\theta_2=\theta_3+\theta_4=90^\circ\;</math>
(since opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary). Then:<ref>In [[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium]], [[Copernicus]] does not refer to Pythagoras' Theorem by name but uses the term 'Porism' – a word which in this particular context would appear to denote an observation on – or obvious consequence of – another existing theorem. The 'Porism' can be viewed on pages [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&db_key=AST&page_ind=36&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES 36 and 37] of DROC (Harvard electronic copy)</ref>

:<math>\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3+\theta_4) \, </math>

: <math> \sin^2\theta_1+\sin^2\theta_2=\sin^2(\theta_1+\theta_2) \,  </math>

: <math> \sin^2\theta_1+\cos^2\theta_1=1 \, </math>

===Corollary 2. The law of cosines===
[[Image:Corollary 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Corollary 2: The Law of Cosines]] 

Let <math>\theta_2=\theta_4\;</math>. The rectangle of corollary 1 is now a symmetrical trapezium with equal diagonals and a pair of equal sides. The parallel sides differ in length by <math>2x</math> units where:
:<math>x=S_2\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)\;</math>

It will be easier in this case to revert to the standard statement of Ptolemy's theorem:

:<math>\begin{array}{lcl}\\
S_1 S_3 +S_2 S_4=\overline{AC}\cdot\overline{BD}\\
\Rightarrow S_1 S_3+S_2^2=\overline{AC}^2\\
\Rightarrow S_1[S_1-2S_2\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)]+S_2^2=\overline{AC}^2\\
\Rightarrow S_1^2+S_2^2-2S_1S_2\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)=\overline{AC}^2\\
\end{array}</math>

===Corollary 3:  Compound angle sine (+)===

Let

<math>\theta_1+\theta_2=\theta_3+\theta_4=90^\circ. \;</math>

Then

:<math>
\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3+\theta_4)
</math>

Therefore

: <math> \cos\theta_2\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\cos\theta_3=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\times 1 \, </math>

===Corollary 4: Compound angle sine (−) ===
Let <math>\theta_1=90^\circ</math>.  Then <math>\theta_2+(\theta_3+\theta_4)=90^\circ</math>.  Hence,

:<math>\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3+\theta_4) \, </math>

: <math> \sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\cos\theta_2 \, </math>

: <math>\sin\theta_3=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\cos\theta_2-\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)\sin\theta_2 \, </math>

as chronicled by [[Copernicus]] following [[Ptolemy]] in [[Almagest]]. In particular if the sides of a pentagon (subtending 36° at the circumference) and of a hexagon (subtending 30° at the circumference) are given, a chord subtending 6° may be calculated. This was a critical step in the ancient method of calculating tables of chords.<ref>To understand the Third Theorem, compare the Copernican diagram shown on page 39 of the [http://ads.harvard.edu/books/1543droc.book/ Harvard copy] of De Revolutionibus to that for the derivation of sin(A-B) found in the above [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/sine_cosine.shtml cut-the-knot] web page</ref>

===Corollary 5: Compound angle cosine (+)===

This corollary is the core of  the [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&db_key=AST&page_ind=39&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES Fifth Theorem] as chronicled by Copernicus following Ptolemy in Almagest.

Let <math>\theta_3=90^\circ</math>.  Then <math>\theta_1+(\theta_2+\theta_4)=90^\circ </math>.  Hence

:<math> \sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3+\theta_4) \, </math>

: <math> \cos(\theta_2+\theta_4)+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\cos\theta_2\cos\theta_4 \, </math>

: <math>\cos(\theta_2+\theta_4)=\cos\theta_2\cos\theta_4-\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4 \, </math>

Formula for compound angle cosine (+)

Despite lacking the dexterity of our modern trigonometric notation, it should be clear from the above corollaries that in Ptolemy's theorem (or more simply the [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&db_key=AST&page_ind=37&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES Second Theorem]) the ancient world had at its disposal an extremely flexible and powerful trigonometric tool which enabled the cognoscenti of those times to draw up accurate tables of chords (corresponding to tables of sines) and to use these in their attempts to understand and map the cosmos as they saw it. Since tables of chords were drawn up by [[Hipparchus]] three centuries before Ptolemy, we must assume he knew of the 'Second Theorem' and  its derivatives. Following the trail of ancient astronomers, history records the star catalogue of [[Timocharis]] of Alexandria. If, as seems likely, the compilation of such catalogues required an understanding of the 'Second Theorem' then the true origins of the latter disappear thereafter into the mists of antiquity but it cannot be unreasonable to presume that the astronomers, architects and construction engineers of ancient Egypt may have had some knowledge of it.

==Ptolemy's inequality==
[[Image:Ptolemy Inequality.svg|thumb|This is ''not'' a cyclic quadrilateral. The equality never holds here, and is unequal in the direction indicated by Ptolemy's inequality.]]

The equation in Ptolemy's theorem is never true with non-cyclic quadrilaterals. '''Ptolemy's inequality''' is an extension of this fact, and it is a more general form of Ptolemy's theorem. It states that, given a quadrilateral ''ABCD'', then

: <math>\overline{AB}\cdot \overline{CD}+\overline{BC}\cdot \overline{DA} \ge \overline{AC}\cdot \overline{BD}</math>

where equality holds if and only if the quadrilateral is [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]]. This special case is equivalent to Ptolemy's theorem.
