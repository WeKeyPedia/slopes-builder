In [[geometry]], the term '''pseudosphere''' is used to describe various surfaces with constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]]. Depending on context, it can refer to either a theoretical surface of constant negative curvature, to a tractricoid, or to a hyperboloid.
__TOC__

== Theoretical pseudosphere ==
In its general interpretation, a '''pseudosphere''' of radius ''R'' is any surface of [[Gaussian curvature|curvature]] &minus;1/''R''<sup>2</sup> (precisely, a [[complete metric space|complete]], [[simply connected]] surface of that curvature), by analogy with the sphere of radius ''R'', which is a surface of curvature 1/''R''<sup>2</sup>. The term was introduced by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in his 1868 paper on models of [[hyperbolic geometry]].<ref>{{Citation

== Tractricoid ==
[[Image:Pseudosphere.png|right|frame|Tractricoid]]
The term is also used to refer to a certain surface called the '''tractricoid''': the result of [[surface of revolution|revolving]] a [[tractrix]] about its [[asymptote]]. As an example, the (half) pseudosphere (with radius 1) is the surface of revolution of the tractrix parametrized by<ref>{{cite book

It is a [[Mathematical singularity|singular space]] (the equator is a singularity), but away from the singularities, it has constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]] and therefore is locally [[isometry|isometric]] to a [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]].

The name "pseudosphere" comes about because it is a [[dimension|two-dimensional]] [[surface]] of constant negative curvature just like a sphere with positive Gauss curvature.
Just as the [[sphere]] has at every point a [[positive number|positively]] curved geometry of a [[dome]] the whole pseudosphere has at every point the [[negative number|negatively]] curved geometry of a [[saddle surface|saddle]].

As early as 1693 [[Christiaan Huygens]] found that the volume and the surface area of the pseudosphere are finite,<ref>{{cite book

== Universal covering space ==
The half pseudosphere of curvature &minus;1 is [[covering space|covered]] by the portion of the hyperbolic upper half-plane with ''y''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1.<ref>{{citation|first=William|last=Thurston|title=Three-dimensional geometry and topology|volume=1|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|page=62}}.</ref>  The covering map is periodic in the ''x'' direction of period 2π, and takes the horocycles ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'' to the meridians of the pseudosphere and the vertical geodesics ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'' to the tractrices that generate the pseudosphere.  This mapping is a local isometry, and thus exhibits the portion ''y''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1 of the upper half-plane as the [[universal covering space]] of the pseudosphere.  The precise mapping is
:<math>(x,y)\mapsto (v(\operatorname{arcosh} y)\cos x, v(\operatorname{arcosh} y) \sin x, u(\operatorname{arcosh} y))</math>
where <math>t\mapsto (u(t),v(t))</math> is the arclength parametrization of the tractrix above.

== Hyperboloid ==
In some sources that use the [[hyperboloid model]] of the hyperbolic plane, the [[hyperboloid]] is referred to as a '''pseudosphere'''.<ref>{{Citation

This usage of the word is because the hyperboloid can be [[hyperboloid#Relation to the sphere|thought of as a sphere]] of imaginary radius, embedded in a [[Minkowski space]].
