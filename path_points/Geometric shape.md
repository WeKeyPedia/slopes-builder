A '''geometric shape''' is the [[Geometry|geometric]] information which remains when [[Translation (geometry)|location]], [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]], [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] and [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] are removed from the description of a [[Mathematical object|geometric object]].<ref>{{cite journal|

Objects that have the same shape as each other are said to be [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]]. If they also have the same scale as each other, they are said to be [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]].

Many two-dimensional geometric shapes can be defined by a set of [[Point (geometry)|points]] or [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] and [[line (geometry)|lines]] connecting the points in a closed chain, as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called [[polygon]]s and include [[triangle]]s, [[square]]s, and [[pentagon]]s. Other shapes may be bounded by [[curve]]s such as the [[circle]] or the [[ellipse]].

Many three-dimensional geometric shapes can be defined by a set of vertices, lines connecting the vertices, and two-dimensional [[Face (geometry)|faces]] enclosed by those lines, as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called [[polyhedron]]s and include [[cube]]s as well as [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]] such as [[tetrahedron]]s. Other three-dimensional shapes may be bounded by curved surfaces, such as the [[ellipsoid]] and the [[sphere]].

A shape is said to be [[Convex polytope|convex]] if all of the points on a line segment between any two of its points are also part of the shape.
