A '''fractal''' is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a [[self-similar]] pattern. An example of this is the [[Menger Sponge]].<ref name="Gouyet" /> Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels. This latter pattern is illustrated in [[#Mandelbrot zooms|Figure 1]].<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /><ref name="Falconer" /><ref name="patterns" /><ref name="vicsek"/> Fractals also includes the idea of a detailed pattern that repeats itself.<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" />{{rp|166; 18}}<ref name="Falconer" /><ref name="Mandelbrot quote">

Fractals are different from other geometric figures because of the way in which they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a [[polygon]] multiplies its [[area]] by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its [[volume]] scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). But if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an [[integer]].<ref name="Mandelbrot1983">

The mathematical [[#history|roots of the idea]] of fractals have been traced throughout the years as a formal path of published works, starting in the 17th century with notions of [[recursion]], then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of [[Continuous function|continuous]] but not [[differentiable]] functions in the 19th century, and on to the coining of the word ''[[wikt:fractal|fractal]]'' in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 21st century.<ref name="classics" /><ref name="MacTutor" /> The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] in 1975.

== Introduction ==
The word "fractal" often has different connotations for laypeople than for mathematicians, where the layperson is more likely to be familiar with [[fractal art]] than a mathematical conception. The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.

The feature of "self-similarity", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over. Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the [[infinite regress]] in parallel mirrors or the [[homunculus]], the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" />{{rp|166; 18}}<ref name="Falconer" /><ref name="Mandelbrot quote" />

This idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or [[fractal dimension]] greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric [[shapes]] are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the curve in [[#koch|Figure 2]]. It is also 1-dimensional for the same [[reason]] as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a fractal dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The fractal curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its [[fractal dimension]].

This also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are "nowhere [[differentiable]]". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways.<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /><ref name="vicsek" /><ref name="Gordon" /> To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of [[rectifiable curve|measuring]] with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the one in Figure 2, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve. This is perhaps counter-intuitive, but it is how fractals behave.<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" />

</ref> In his writings, Leibniz used the term "fractional exponents", but lamented that "Geometry" did not yet know of them.<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" />{{rp|405}} Indeed, according to various historical accounts, after that point few mathematicians tackled the issues and the work of those who did remained obscured largely because of resistance to such unfamiliar emerging concepts, which were sometimes referred to as mathematical "monsters".<ref name="Gordon" /><ref name="classics" /><ref name="MacTutor" /> Thus, it was not until two centuries had passed that in 1872 [[Karl Weierstrass]] presented the first definition of a [[Weierstrass function|function]] with a [[Graph of a function|graph]] that would today be considered fractal, having the non-[[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] property of being everywhere [[continuous function|continuous]] but [[nowhere differentiable]].<ref name="classics" />{{rp|7}}<ref name="MacTutor" /> Not long after that, in 1883, [[Georg Cantor]], who attended lectures by Weierstrass,<ref name="MacTutor" /> published examples of [[subset]]s of the real line known as [[Cantor set]]s, which had unusual properties and are now recognized as fractals.<ref name="classics" />{{rp|11–24}} Also in the last part of that century, [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincaré]] introduced a category of fractal that has come to be called "self-inverse" fractals.<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" />{{rp|166}}

{{anchor|julia}}
[[Image:Julia set (indigo).png|thumb|upright|Figure 3. A [[Julia set]], a fractal related to the Mandelbrot set]]
One of the next milestones came in 1904, when [[Helge von Koch]], extending ideas of Poincaré and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch curve]] (see [[#koch|Figure 2]]).<ref name="classics" />{{rp|25}}<ref name="MacTutor" /> Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when [[Wacław Sierpiński]] constructed his famous [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] then, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]]. By 1918, two French mathematicians, [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]], though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what are now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping [[complex numbers]] and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about [[strange attractors|attractors and repellors]] (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important in the study of fractals (see [[#julia|Figure 3]] and [[#Strange attractor|Figure 4]]).<ref name="vicsek" /><ref name="classics" /><ref name="MacTutor" /> Very shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, [[Felix Hausdorff]] expanded the definition of "dimension", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have noninteger dimensions.<ref name="MacTutor" /> The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], who, in his 1938 paper ''Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole'' described a new fractal curve, the [[Lévy C curve]].<ref group="notes" name="levy note" />

Different researchers have postulated that without the aid of modern computer graphics, early investigators were limited to what they could depict in manual drawings, so lacked the means to visualize the beauty and appreciate some of the implications of many of the patterns they had discovered (the Julia set, for instance, could only be visualized through a few iterations as very simple drawings hardly resembling the image in [[#julia|Figure 3]]).<ref name="Mandelbrot1983" />{{rp|179}}<ref name = "Gordon">{{cite book

According to Falconer, rather than being strictly defined, fractals should, in addition to being nowhere differentiable and able to have a [[fractal dimension]], be generally characterized by a [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] of the following features;<ref name="Falconer" />

:* Self-similarity, which may be manifested as:
::* Exact self-similarity: ''identical at all scales; e.g. [[#koch|Koch snowflake]]''
::* Quasi self-similarity: ''approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the [[Mandelbrot set]]'s satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies, as shown in  [[#Mandelbrot zooms|Figure 1]]''
::* Statistical self-similarity: ''repeats a pattern [[stochastic]]ally so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., [[#random|randomly generated fractals]]; the well-known example of the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]], for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines, for example, the Koch snowflake<ref name="vicsek" />
::*Qualitative self-similarity: ''as in a time series''<ref name="time series">{{cite book | last = Peters | first = Edgar | title = Chaos and order in the capital markets : a new view of cycles, prices, and market volatility | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-471-13938-6 }}</ref>
::* [[Multifractal]] scaling: ''characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule''
:* Fine or detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. A consequence of this structure is fractals may have [[emergent properties]]<ref>{{cite book | first1=John |last1=Spencer |first2=Michael S.

:* Irregularity locally and globally that is not easily described in traditional [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] language. For images of fractal patterns, this has been expressed by phrases such as "smoothly piling up surfaces" and "swirls upon swirls".<ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos" />
:* Simple and "perhaps [[recursion|recursive]]" definitions ''see [[#algorithms|Common techniques for generating fractals]]''

As a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, is easily described in Euclidean language, has the same [[Hausdorff dimension]] as [[topological dimension]], and is fully defined without a need for recursion.<ref name ="Mandelbrot1983" /><ref name="vicsek" />

== Simulated fractals ==
[[File:Apophysis-100303-104.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[fractal flame]]]]
Fractal patterns have been modeled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or [[#fractals in nature|natural phenomena with fractal features]]. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for [[fractal analysis]]. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed [[#fractals in technology|elsewhere]]. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being "fractals" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display [[Artifact (error)|artifacts]] which are not characteristics of true fractals.

Modeled fractals may be sounds,<ref name="music" /> digital images, electrochemical patterns, [[circadian rhythm]]s,<ref>{{cite doi |10.1142/S0218348X11005476}}</ref> etc.
Fractal patterns have been reconstructed in physical 3-dimensional space<ref name="medicine" />{{rp|10}} and virtually, often called "[[in silico]]" modeling.<ref name="modeling vasculature" /> Models of fractals are generally created using [[fractal-generating software]] that implements techniques such as those outlined above.<ref name="vicsek" /><ref name="time series" /><ref name="medicine" /> As one illustration, trees, ferns, cells of the nervous system,<ref name="branching" /> blood and lung vasculature,<ref name="modeling vasculature">{{cite book

Similarly, random fractals have been used to describe/create many highly irregular real-world objects. A limitation of modeling fractals is that resemblance of a fractal model to a natural phenomenon does not prove that the phenomenon being modeled is formed by a process similar to the modeling algorithms.

{{further|Patterns in nature}}

Approximate fractals found in nature display self-similarity over extended, but finite, scale ranges. The connection between fractals and leaves, for instance, is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees.<ref>"[[Hunting the Hidden Dimension]]." ''Nova''. PBS. WPMB-Maryland. 28 October 2008.</ref>

{{Further|Fractal art}}

Fractal patterns have been found in the paintings of American artist [[Jackson Pollock]]. While Pollock's paintings appear to be composed of chaotic dripping and splattering, computer analysis has found fractal patterns in his work.<ref name="fractal painting">{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/PHYSICS_!/FRACTAL_EXPRESSIONISM/fractal_taylor.html |first1=Richard |last1=Taylor |first2=Adam P. |last2=Micolich |first3=David |last3=Jonas |title=Fractal Expressionism: Can Science Be Used To Further Our Understanding Of Art? |publisher=Phys.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>

[[Decalcomania]], a technique used by artists such as [[Max Ernst]], can produce fractal-like patterns.<ref>Frame, Michael; and Mandelbrot, Benoît B.; [http://classes.yale.edu/Fractals/Panorama/ ''A Panorama of Fractals and Their Uses'']</ref> It involves pressing paint between two surfaces and pulling them apart.

Cyberneticist [[Ron Eglash]] has suggested that fractal geometry and mathematics are prevalent in [[African art]], [[game]]s, [[divination]], [[trade]], and [[architecture]]. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles.<ref name="African art">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/eglash.dir/afractal/afractal.htm |first=Ron |last=Eglash |title=African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design |location=New Brunswick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}</ref><ref>Nelson, Bryn; [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/02/23/MN36684.DTL ''Sophisticated Mathematics Behind African Village Designs Fractal patterns use repetition on large, small scale''], San Francisco Chronicle, Wednesday, February 23, 2009</ref>

In a 1996 interview with [[Michael Silverblatt]], [[David Foster Wallace]] admitted that the structure of the first draft of ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch was inspired by fractals, specifically the [[Sierpinski triangle]] (a.k.a. Sierpinski gasket) but that the edited novel is "more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket".<ref name="novel">{{cite web |url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw/bw960411david_foster_wallace |first=David Foster |last=Wallace |title=Bookworm on KCRW |publisher=Kcrw.com |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}</ref>

==In law==
If a rule or principle of law is conceptualized as defining a two-dimensional "area" of conduct, conduct within which should be legal and conduct outside of which should be illegal, it has been observed that the border of that area must be a fractal, because of the infinite and recursive potential exceptions and extensions necessary to account appropriately for all variations in fact pattern that may arise.<ref name="legal fractal"/>

===Fractal-generating programs===
There are many fractal generating programs available, both free and commercial. Some of the fractal generating programs include:

* [[Apophysis (software)|Apophysis]] - [[open source]] software for [[Microsoft Windows]] based systems
* [[Electric Sheep]] - [[open source]] distributed computing software
* [[Fractint]] - [[freeware]] with available [[source code]]
* [[Sterling program|Sterling]] - Freeware software for [[Microsoft Windows]] based systems
* [[SpangFract]] - For Mac OS
* [[Ultra Fractal]] - A [[proprietary software|proprietary]] fractal generator for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] based systems
* [[XaoS]] - A cross platform [[open source]] fractal zooming program 
* [[Chaotica (software)|Chaotica]] - a commercial software for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS]]
* [[Terragen]] - a [[fractal terrain]] generator.

Most of the above programs make two-dimensional fractals, with a few creating three-dimensional fractal objects, such as [[quaternion]]s, [[mandelbulb]]s and [[mandelbox]]es.
