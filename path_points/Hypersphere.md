In [[geometry]] of higher dimensions, a '''hypersphere''' is the set of points at a constant distance from a given point called its '''center'''. The surface of the hypersphere is a [[manifold]] of one dimension less than the ambient space. As the radius increases the [[curvature]] of the hypersphere decreases; in the limit a hypersphere approaches the zero curvature of a [[hyperplane]]. Both hyperplanes and hyperspheres are [[hypersurface]]s.

The term ''hypersphere'' was introduced by [[Duncan Sommerville]] in his discussion of models for non-Euclidean geometry.<ref>D. M. Y. Sommerville (1914) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/ABN6053.0001.001/1?rgn=works;view=pdf;rgn1=author;q1=Sommerville The Elements of Non-Euclidean Geometry], page 193, link from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection</ref> The first one mentioned is a [[3-sphere]] in four dimensions.

Some spheres are not hyperspheres: suppose ''S'' is a sphere in E<sup>m</sup> where ''m'' < ''n'' and the space had ''n'' dimensions, then ''S'' is not a hypersphere. Similarly, any [[n-sphere]] in a proper [[flat (geometry)|flat]] is not a hypersphere.
