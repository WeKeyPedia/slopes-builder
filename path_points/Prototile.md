[[File:Penrose Tiling (Rhombi).svg|thumb|240px|This form of the [[aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]] [[Penrose tiling]] has two prototiles, a fat [[rhombus]] (shown blue in the figure) and a thin rhombus (green).]]
In the mathematical theory of [[tessellation]]s, a '''prototile''' is one of the shapes of a tile in a tessellation.<ref>{{citation|page=174|title=A Course in Modern Geometries|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|first=Judith N.|last=Cederberg|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2001|isbn=978-0-387-98972-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fo9tqL99jdMC&pg=PA174}}.</ref>

A tessellation of the plane or of any other space is a cover of the space by [[closed set|closed]] shapes, called tiles, that have [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[interior (topology)|interiors]]. Some of the tiles may be [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to one or more others. If {{mvar|S}} is the set of tiles in a tessellation, a set {{mvar|R}} of shapes is called a set of prototiles if no two shapes in {{mvar|R}} are congruent to each other, and every tile in {{mvar|S}} is congruent to one of the shapes in {{mvar|R}}.<ref>{{citation|page=7|title=Introductory Tiling Theory for Computer Graphics|series=Synthesis Lectures on Computer Graphics and Animation|first=Craig S.|last=Kaplan|publisher=Morgan & Claypool Publishers|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60845-017-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OPtQtnNXRMMC&pg=PA7}}.</ref>

It is possible to choose many different sets of prototiles for a tiling: translating or rotating any one of the prototiles produces another valid set of prototiles. However, every set of prototiles has the same [[cardinality]], so the number of prototiles is well defined. A tessellation is said to be monohedral if it has exactly one prototile.

A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if every tiling with those prototiles is an [[aperiodic tiling]].  It is unknown whether there a single two-dimensional shape (called an ''[[Einstein problem|einstein]]'')<ref>{{citation

That is, the existence of a single-tile (monohedral) aperiodic prototile set is an open problem. The [[Socolar-Taylor tile]] forms two-dimensional aperiodic tilings, but is defined by combinatorial matching conditions rather than purely by its shape. In higher dimensions, the problem is solved: the [[Schmitt-Conway-Danzer tile]] is the prototile of a monohedral aperiodic tiling of three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], and cannot tile space periodically.
