{{About|a branch of mathematics|the short film starring Ewan McGregor|Solid Geometry (film)}}
In [[mathematics]], '''solid geometry''' was the traditional name for the [[geometry]] of three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. '''Stereometry''' deals with the [[measurement]]s of [[volume]]s of various '''solid figures''' ([[three-dimensional]] figures) including [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]], [[cone (geometry)|cones]], [[Frustum|truncated cones]], [[Sphere|spheres]], and [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]].

The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] dealt with the [[Regular solid|regular solids]], but the pyramid, prism, cone and cylinder were not studied until the [[Platonism|Platonist]]s. [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] established their measurement, proving the pyramid and cone to have one-third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height, and was probably the discoverer of a proof that the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its [[radius]].<ref>''...paraphrased and taken in part from the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''</ref>

==Basic topics of solid geometry==
Basic topics are:
{{colbegin||27em}}
* [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s and [[line (mathematics)|line]]s
* [[dihedral angle]] and [[solid angle]]
* the [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], [[cuboid]], [[parallelepiped]]
* the [[tetrahedron]] and other [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]s
* [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]s
* [[octahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[icosahedron]]
* [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]]
* the [[sphere]]
* other [[quadric]]s: [[spheroid]], [[ellipsoid]], [[paraboloid]] and [[hyperboloid]]s.

==Other topics==
* [[projective geometry]] of three dimensions leading to
* proof of [[Desargues' theorem]] by using an extra dimension
* further [[polyhedra]]
* [[descriptive geometry]].

[[Analytic geometry]] and [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] techniques have a major impact by allowing the systematic use of [[system of linear equations|linear equations]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra; this becomes more important for higher dimensions. A major reason to study this subject is the application to [[computer graphics]], meaning that [[algorithm]]s become important.
