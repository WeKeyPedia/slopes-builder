A '''tessellation''' of a flat surface is the tiling of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In [[mathematics]], tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions.

A periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include [[Tiling by regular polygons|regular tilings]] with [[regular polygon]]al tiles all of the same shape, and [[Tiling by regular polygons#Archimedean, uniform or semiregular tilings|semi-regular tilings]] with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 [[wallpaper groups]]. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called "non-periodic". An [[aperiodic tiling]] uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space filling or [[honeycomb]] is also called a tessellation of space.

A real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as [[cement]]ed [[ceramic]] squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative [[patterns]], or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant [[pavement (architecture)|pavement]], floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in [[Ancient Rome]] and in [[Islamic art]] such as in the decorative tiling of the [[Alhambra]] palace. In the twentieth century, the work of [[M. C. Escher]] often made use of tessellations for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in [[quilting]]. Tessellations form a class of [[patterns in nature]], for example in the arrays of [[Hexagonal tiling|hexagonal cells]] found in [[honeycomb]]s.

==History==

Tessellations were used by the [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Sumerians]] (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.<ref name="Pickover2009">{{cite book|last=Pickover|first=Clifford A.|title=The math book: from Pythagoras to the 57th dimension, 250 milestones in the history of mathematics|year=2009|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc|isbn=9781402757969|page=372}}</ref>

In 1619 [[Johannes Kepler]] made one of the first documented studies of tessellations when he wrote about regular and semiregular tessellation, which are coverings of a plane with regular polygons, in his ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]''.<ref>[[Johannes Kepler|Kepler, Johannes]] (1619).

===Etymology===

In Latin, ''tessella'' is a small cubical piece of [[clay]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[glass]] used to make [[mosaic]]s.<ref>[http://m-w.com/dictionary/tessellate tessellate], Merriam-Webster Online</ref> The word "tessella" means "small square" (from "[[tessera]]", square, which in its turn is from the Greek word "τέσσερα" for "four"). It corresponds with the everyday term ''tiling'' which refers to applications of tessellations, often made of [[ceramic glaze|glazed]] clay.

==Overview==

[[File:Semi-regular-floor-3464.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A [[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]]: tiled floor of a church in [[Seville]], Spain, using square, triangle and hexagon prototiles]]

Tessellation or tiling in two dimensions is the branch of mathematics that studies how shapes, known as ''tiles'', can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. A common one is that all corners should meet and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another.<ref>Conway, R. Burgiel, H. and Goodman-Strauss, G.; ''The Symmetries of Things'', Peters (2008).</ref> The tessellations created by [[Bond (brick)|bonded brickwork]] do not obey this rule. Among those which do, a [[regular tessellation]] has both identical{{efn|The mathematical term for identical shapes is "congruent" - in mathematics, "identical" means they are the same tile.}} [[regular polygon|regular tiles]] and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile.<ref>Coxeter, HSM; ''Regular Polytopes'', Third Edition, Dover (1973) - Coxeter defines this condition for a regular polyhedron then treats tilings as infinite polyhedra.</ref> There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral [[triangle]], [[square]], and regular [[hexagon]]. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] with no gaps at all. Honeycombs are famous for the tessellating hexagons they use.

Many other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner.<ref>Cundy & Rollett, ''mathematical Models'', 2nd Ed., Oxford (1961), Pages 61-62</ref> Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as [[pentagons]], [[polyominoes]] and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist [[M. C. Escher]] is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to form physical surfaces such as church floors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/pavimento.bsm | title=Basilica di San Marco | publisher=Basilica di San Marco, Venice, Italy | work=Section dedicated to the tessellated floor | accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>

More formally, a tessellation or tiling is a [[cover (topology)|cover]] of the Euclidean plane by a [[countable]] number of closed sets, called ''tiles'', such that the tiles intersect only on their [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]]. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes.{{efn|The tiles are usually required to be [[Homeomorphism|topologically]] equivalent to a [[closed disk]], which means bizarre shapes with holes, dangling line segments or infinite areas are excluded.<ref name=Grunbaum/>}} Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of [[prototile]]s in which all tiles in the tessellation are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to ''tessellate'' or to ''tile the plane''.  A general method for identifying shapes which will tile the plane periodically without reflections is known as the [[Conway criterion]].<ref>''Will It Tile? Try the Conway Criterion!'' by Doris Schattschneider Mathematics Magazine Vol. 53, No. 4 (Sep., 1980), pp. 224-233</ref>  However, mathematicians have found no general rule for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.<ref name=Grunbaum/> For example, the types of convex pentagon that can tile the plane remains an unsolved problem.

Mathematically, tessellations can be extended to spaces other than the Euclidean plane.<ref name=Gullberg>Gullberg, 1997. p. 395</ref> The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[geometry|geometer]] [[Ludwig Schläfli]] pioneered this by defining ''polyschemes'', which mathematicians nowadays call [[polytopes]]; these are the analogues to polygons and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the [[Schläfli symbol]] notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iWvXsVInpgMC&lpg=PP1 | title=Regular Polytopes | publisher=Methuen | author=Coxeter, H. S. M. | year=1948 | pages=14, 69, 149}}</ref> The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.<ref name="MathWorldTessellation">{{cite web | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tessellation.html | title=Tessellation | publisher=Wolfram MathWorld | date=1999–2013 | accessdate=26 April 2013 | author=Weisstein, Eric W.}}</ref>

Other methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made of regular polygons, the most common notation is the [[vertex configuration]], which is simply a list of the number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 4<sup>4</sup>. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 6<sup>3</sup>.<ref name=Grunbaum>{{cite book|last=Grünbaum|first=Branko|title=Tilings and Patterns|year=1987|publisher=W. H.

===Kinds of tessellations===
{{further|tiling by regular polygons}}
[[File:Tiling Semiregular 3-4-6-4 Small Rhombitrihexagonal.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Rhombitrihexagonal tiling|3.4.6.4 semi-regular tessellation]] is made with three prototiles: a triangle, a square and a hexagon. Every vertex has a triangle, square, hexagon, square around it, in that order.]]

Mathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings. An ''edge'' is the intersection between two bordering tiles; it is often a straight line. A ''vertex'' is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an ''isogonal'' or [[vertex-transitive]] tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of [[polygon]]s about each vertex is the same. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.<ref name=Grunbaum/>

The sides of the polygons are not necessarily identical to the edges of the tiles. An ''edge-to-edge'' tessellation is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an edge-to-edge tessellation, the sides of the polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar "brick wall" tiling is not edge-to-edge because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.<ref name=Grunbaum/>

A ''normal tiling'' is a tessellation for which (1) every tile is [[topologically]] equivalent to a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], (2) the intersection of any two tiles is a single [[connected set]] or the [[empty set]], and (3) all tiles are [[uniformly bounded]].<ref name=Horne2000>{{cite book|last=Horne|first=Clare E.|title=Geometric Symmetry in Patterns and Tilings|year=2000|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=9781855734920}}</ref>{{rp|172}} A uniformly bounded tile is one in which a finite circle can be circumscribed around the tile and a finite circle can be inscribed within the tile; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.
 
A <span id="Monohedral" style="white-pace:nowrap;font-weight:bold">monohedral tiling</span> is a tessellation in which all tiles are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936, with the Voderberg tiling having a unit tile that is a nonconvex [[enneagon]].<ref name="Pickover2009" /> The '''Hirschhorn tiling''', published by [[Michael D. Hirschhorn]]  and D. C. Hunt in 1985, has a unit tile that is an irregular [[pentagon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/radspir1.htm | title=Some Special Radial and Spiral Tilings | publisher=University of Wisconsin | date=29 July 1999 | accessdate=6 April 2013 | author=Dutch, Steven}}</ref><ref name=Hirschhorn1985>{{cite journal|last=Hirschhorn|first=M.

An ''isohedral tiling'' is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to the same ''transitivity class'', that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the symmetry group of the tiling.<ref name=Horne2000 />{{rp|175}} If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is call ''anisohedral'' and forms [[anisohedral tiling]]s.

A [[Tiling by regular polygons|regular tessellation]] is a highly [[symmetry|symmetric]], edge-to-edge tiling made up of [[regular polygon]]s, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of [[equilateral triangle]]s, [[square (geometry)|square]]s, or regular [[hexagon]]s. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularTessellation.html MathWorld: Regular Tessellations]</ref>

A [[Tiling by regular polygons#Archimedean, uniform or semiregular tilings|semi-regular (or Archimedean) tessellation]] uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two).<ref>Stewart, 2001. p. 75</ref> These can be described by their [[vertex configuration]]; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.8<sup>2</sup> (each vertex has one square and two octagons).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nrich.maths.org/1556 | title=Schlafli Tessellations | publisher=University of Cambridge | date=1997–2012 | accessdate=26 April 2013 | author=NRICH (Millennium Maths Project)}}</ref>

[[Penrose tiling]]s, which use two different quadrilaterals, are the best known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of [[aperiodic tiling]]s, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically, though they have surprising [[self-replication|self-replicating]] properties using the [[recursion|recursive process]] of [[substitution tiling]].<ref>Gardner, 1989.</ref>

[[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi or Dirichlet]] tilings are tessellations where each tile is defined as the set of points closest to one of the points in a discrete set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.)<ref>Franz Aurenhammer (1991).  ''Voronoi Diagrams – A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure''.  ACM Computing Surveys, 23(3):345–405, 1991</ref><ref>Atsuyuki Okabe, Barry Boots, Kokichi Sugihara & Sung Nok Chiu (2000).

The [[Delaunay triangulation]] is a tessellation that is the [[dual graph]] of a Voronoi tessellation.

===Wallpaper groups===
{{Main|Wallpaper group}}
Tilings with [[translational symmetry]] in two independent directions can be categorized by [[wallpaper group]]s, of which 17 exist.<ref name=armstrong>{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=M.A.|title=Groups and Symmetry|year=1988|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=978-3-540-96675-3}}</ref> It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]], [[Spain]].

===Tessellations and colour===
{{further|four colour theorem}}

[[File:Torus with seven colours.svg|thumb|right|If the colours of this tiling are to form a repeat pattern, at least seven colours are required. If the colouring is allowed to be aperiodic, then at least [[four colour theorem|four colours]] are needed. This tiling can be used on the surface of a [[torus]].]]

Sometimes the colour of a tile is understood as part of the tiling, at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The [[four colour theorem]] states that for every tessellation of a normal [[Euclidean plane]], with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem will not in general respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.<ref>Hazewinkel, 2001.</ref>

===Tessellations with triangles and quadrilaterals===

Any triangle or [[quadrilateral]] (even [[Convex and concave polygons|non-convex]]) can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often in more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary [[quadrilateral]] can form a tessellation with 2-fold rotational centres at the midpoints of all sides, and translational symmetry whose basis vectors are the diagonal of the quadrilateral or, equivalently, one of these and the sum or difference of the two. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to [[Wallpaper group#Group p2|wallpaper group p2]]. As [[fundamental domain]] we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a [[parallelogram]] subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.<ref>Jones, 1856.</ref>

===Tessellations in higher dimensions===

Tessellation can be extended to three dimensions. Certain [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] can be stacked in a regular [[Bravais lattice|crystal pattern]] to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the [[cube]] (the only regular polyhedron to do so); the [[rhombic dodecahedron]]; and the [[truncated octahedron]].<ref name="Biprism">{{cite web | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tessellation.html | title=Schmitt-Conway Biprism | publisher=Wolfram MathWorld | date=1999–2013 | accessdate=28 April 2013 | author=Weisstein, Eric W.}}</ref> Some [[crystal]]s including [[Andradite]] (a kind of [[Garnet]]) and [[Fluorite]] can take the form of rhombic dodecahedra.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ajsgem.com/gemstone-information/rhodolite-garnet-51.html | title=Rhodolite Garnet Gemstone Information | publisher=AJS Gems | accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.galleries.com/Andradite | title=The mineral Andradite | publisher=Amethyst Galleries | date=1995–2013 | accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>

The [[Schmitt-Conway biprism]] is a convex polyhedron which has the property of tiling space only [[aperiodic]]ally. [[John Horton Conway]] discovered it in 1993.<ref name="Biprism"/>

Tessellations in three or more dimensions are called [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]. In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular{{efn|In this context, quasiregular means that the cells are regular (solids), and the vertex figures are semiregular.}} honeycomb, which has eight [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] and six [[octahedron|octahedra]] at each polyhedron vertex. However there are many possible [[Convex uniform honeycomb|semiregular honeycombs]] in three dimensions.<ref name="Biprism"/>

In architecture, tessellations have been used to create decorative motifs since ancient times. [[Mosaic]] tilings were used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], often with geometric patterns.<ref>{{cite book | title=Geometric Patterns from Roman Mosaics | publisher=Tarquin | author=Field, Robert | year=1988 | isbn=978-0-906-21263-9}}</ref> Later civilisations also used larger tiles, either plain or individually decorated. Some of the most decorative were the [[Moorish]] wall tilings of buildings such as the [[Alhambra]] and the [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] mosque of [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|La Mezquita]].

Tessellated designs also often appear on textiles, either woven or stitched in or printed.

[[Basalt]]ic [[lava flow]]s often display [[Basalt#Columnar_basalt|columnar jointing]] as a result of [[Thermal expansion#Contraction effects|contraction]] forces causing cracks as the lava cools.
