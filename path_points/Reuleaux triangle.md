[[File:ReuleauxTriangle.svg|frame|right|The Reuleaux triangle is a constant width curve based on an equilateral triangle. All points on a side are equidistant from the opposite vertex.]]
A '''Reuleaux triangle''' is the simplest and best known Reuleaux polygon. It is a [[curve of constant width]], meaning that the separation of two parallel lines tangent to the curve is independent of their orientation. Because all diameters are the same, the Reuleaux triangle is one answer to the question "Other than a circle, what shape can a [[manhole cover]] be made so that it cannot fall down through the hole?" The term derives from [[Franz Reuleaux]], a 19th-century German engineer who did pioneering work on ways that machines translate one type of motion into another, although the concept was known before his time.

== Construction ==
[[File:Construction triangle Reuleaux.svg|thumb|left|150px|To construct a Reuleaux triangle]]

With a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]], sweep an arc sufficient to enclose the desired figure. With radius unchanged, sweep a sufficient arc centred at a point on the first arc to intersect that arc. With the same radius and the centre at that intersection sweep a third arc to intersect the other arcs. The result is a curve of constant width.

Equivalently, given an [[equilateral triangle]] ''T'' of side length ''s'', take the boundary of the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the disks with [[radius]] ''s'' centered at the vertices of ''T''.

By the [[Blaschke–Lebesgue theorem]], the Reuleaux triangle has the least area of any curve of given constant width. This area is <math>{1\over2}(\pi - \sqrt3)s^2</math>, where ''s'' is the constant width. The existence of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section.

The area of Reuleaux triangle is smaller than that of the [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] of the same width (i.e. diameter); the area of such a disk is <math>\pi s^2 \over 4</math>.

== Reuleaux polygons ==
[[File:Reuleaux polygons.svg|thumb|Reuleaux polygons]]
The Reuleaux triangle can be generalized to [[regular polygon]]s with an odd number of sides, yielding a '''Reuleaux polygon'''. The most commonly used of these is the Reuleaux heptagon, which is approximately the shape of several coins:
* [[Botswana pula]] coins in the denominations of 2 pula, 1 pula, 25 thebe and 5 thebe.
* [[Coins of the Cypriot pound#Decimal - cents|Cypriot]] 50-cent coin, from 1991 until Cyprus joined the [[Euro]] in 2008.
* [[Jordan]]ian quarter-[[Jordanian dinar|dinar]] and half-dinar coins.
* [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] 10-[[Mauritian rupee|rupee]] coin.
* [[United Kingdom|British]] [[twenty pence (British coin)|20-pence]] and [[fifty pence (British coin)|50-pence]] coins.
* [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Loonie]] dollar coin (eleven sides).

The constant width of such coins allows their use in coin-operated machines.

[[File:Rouleaux triangle Animation.gif|frame|right|The Reuleaux triangle rotating inside a square]]
* The rotor of the [[Wankel engine]] is easily mistaken for a Reuleaux triangle but its curved sides are somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.<ref>[http://www.der-wankelmotor.de/Techniklexikon/techniklexikon.html Ein Wankel-Rotor ist kein Reuleux-Dreieck!] German [http://translate.google.de/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.der-wankelmotor.de%2FTechniklexikon%2Ftechniklexikon.html&sl=de&tl=en&hl=de&ie=UTF-8 Translation A Wankel-Rotor is not a Reuleux-Triangle!]</ref>

* A Reuleaux triangle (along with all other [[curve of constant width|curves of constant width]]) can roll but makes a poor wheel because it does not roll about a fixed center of rotation. An object on top of rollers with cross-sections that were Reuleaux triangles would roll smoothly and flatly, but an axle attached to Reuleaux triangle wheels would bounce up and down three times per revolution. This concept was used in a science fiction short story by [[Poul Anderson]] titled "Three-Cornered Wheel."<ref>[http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/mfview.php?callnumber=mf613 "Three-Cornered Wheel"]</ref>
* Several pencils are manufactured in this shape, rather than the more traditional round or hexagonal barrels.<ref>http://www.pencilrevolution.com/2006/04/review-of-staedtler-noris-ergosoft-hb/</ref>  They are usually promoted as being more comfortable or encouraging proper grip, as well as being less likely to roll off tables (since the center of gravity moves up and down more than a rolling hexagon).

* Many [[guitar picks]] employ the Reuleaux triangle, as its unique shape combines a sharp point to provide strong articulation, with a wide tip to produce a warm timbre. Many players find the shape ergonomic, since it naturally tends to point in the proper direction. Its three equal tips also prevent wear and extend lifespan, as compared to the single tip of a pick shaped like an [[isosceles triangle]].<ref>Hoover, Will (November 1995).

Alternatively, the [[surface of revolution]] of a Reuleaux triangle through one of its symmetry axes forms a surface of constant width, with minimum volume among all known surfaces of revolution of given constant width ({{harvtxt|Campi|Colesanti|Gronchi|1996}}).
