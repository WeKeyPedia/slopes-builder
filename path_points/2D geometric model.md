A '''2D geometric model''' is a [[geometric model]] of an object as a [[two-dimensional]] figure, usually on the [[Euclidean plane|Euclidean]] or [[Cartesian plane]].  

Even though all material objects are three-dimensional, a 2D geometric model is often adequate for certain flat objects, such as paper cut-outs and machine parts made of [[sheet metal]].  

2D geometric models are also convenient for describing certain types of artificial [[image]]s, such as technical [[diagram]]s, [[logo]]s, the [[glyph]]s of a [[Typeface|font]], etc.  They are an essential tool of [[2D computer graphics]] and often used as components of [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] geometric models, e.g. to describe the [[decal]]s to be applied to a [[automobile|car]] model.
