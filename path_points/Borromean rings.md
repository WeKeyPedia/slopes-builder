In [[mathematics]], the '''Borromean rings'''{{efn|Named after the [[:File:Coat of arms of the House of Borromeo.svg|coat of arms of the Borromeo family]] in 15th-century [[Lombardy]].}} consist of three [[topological]] [[circle]]s which are [[link (knot theory)|linked]] and form a [[Brunnian link]] (''i.e.'', removing any ring results in two unlinked rings).  In other words, no two of the three rings are linked with each other as a [[Hopf link]], but nonetheless all three are linked.

== Mathematical properties ==
Although the typical picture of the Borromean rings (above right picture) may lead one to think the link can be formed from geometrically ideal circles, they ''cannot be''. Freedman and Skora (1987) prove that a certain class of links, including the Borromean links, cannot be exactly circular. Alternatively, this can be seen from considering the [[link diagram]]: if one assumes that circles 1 and 2 touch at their two crossing points, then they either lie in a plane or a sphere. In either case, the third circle must pass through this plane or sphere four times, without lying in it, which is impossible; see {{harv|Lindström|Zetterström|1991}}.

[[File:3d borromean rings by ronbennett2001.jpg|thumb|right|3D image of Borromean Rings]]
It is, however, true that one can use ellipses (right picture). These may be taken to be of [[arbitrarily small]] [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]; i.e. no matter how close to being circular their shape may be, as long as they are not perfectly circular, they can form Borromean links if suitably positioned; as an example, thin circles made from bendable elastic wire may be used as Borromean rings.

=== Linking ===
{{details|Link group}}
In [[knot theory]], the Borromean rings are a simple example of a Brunnian link: although each pair of rings is [[unlink]]ed, the  whole link cannot be unlinked. There are a number of ways of seeing this.

Simplest is that the [[fundamental group]] of the complement of two [[unlinked]] circles is the [[free group]] on two generators, ''a'' and ''b,'' by the [[Seifert–van Kampen theorem]], and then the third loop has the class of the [[commutator]], [''a'',&nbsp;''b'']&nbsp;=&nbsp;''aba''<sup>−1</sup>''b''<sup>−1</sup>, as one can see from the link diagram: over one, over the next, back under the first, back under the second. This is non-trivial in the fundamental group, and thus the Borromean rings are linked.

Another way is that the [[cohomology]] of the complement supports a non-trivial [[Massey product]], which is not the case for the unlink. This is a simple example of the Massey product and further, the algebra corresponds to the geometry: a 3-fold Massey product is a 3-fold product which is only defined if all the 2-fold products vanish, which corresponds to the Borromean rings being pairwise unlinked (2-fold products vanish), but linked overall (3-fold product does not vanish).

In [[arithmetic topology]], there is an analogy between [[knot (mathematics)|knots]] and [[prime number]]s in which one considers links between primes. The triple of primes {{nowrap|(13, 61, 937)}} are linked modulo 2 (the [[Rédei symbol]] is −1) but are pairwise unlinked modulo 2 (the [[Legendre symbol]]s are all 1). Therefore these primes have been called a "proper Borromean triple modulo 2"<ref>{{Citation |last=Vogel |first=Denis |date=13 February 2004 |title=Massey products in the Galois cohomology of number fields |url=http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/4418 |id={{URN|nbn|de:bsz:16-opus-44188}}}}</ref> or "mod 2 Borromean primes".<ref>{{Citation |last=Morishita |first=Masanori |date=22 April 2009 |title=Analogies between Knots and Primes, 3-Manifolds and Number Rings |arxiv=0904.3399}}</ref>

=== Hyperbolic geometry ===
The Borromean rings are a [[hyperbolic link]]: the complement of the Borromean rings in the 3-sphere admits a complete [[Hyperbolic 3-manifold|hyperbolic]] metric of finite volume. The canonical (Epstein-Penner) polyhedral decomposition of the complement consists of two [[regular polyhedron|regular]] [[ideal polyhedron|ideal]] [[octahedron|octahedra]]. The [[hyperbolic volume (knot)|volume]] is 16Л(π/4) = 7.32772… where Л is the [[Lobachevsky function]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Thurston |first=William |authorlink=William Thurston |date=March 2002 |title=The Geometry and Topology of Three-Manifolds |url=http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/ |chapter=7. Computation of volume |chapterurl=http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/PDF/7.pdf |page=165}}</ref>

== Connection with braids ==
[[Image:Braid StepBystep.jpg|right|thumb|The standard 3-strand braid corresponds to the Borromean rings.]]
If one cuts the Borromean rings, one obtains one iteration of the standard [[braid]]; conversely, if one ties together the ends of (one iteration of) a standard braid, one obtains the Borromean rings. Just as removing one Borromean ring unlinks the remaining two, removing one strand of the standard braid unbraids the other two: they are the basic [[Brunnian link]] and [[Brunnian braid]], respectively.

In the standard link diagram, the Borromean rings are ordered non-transitively, in a [[cyclic order]]. Using the colors above, these are red over green, green over blue, blue over red – and thus after removing any one ring, for the remaining two, one is above the other and they can be unlinked. Similarly, in the standard braid, each strand is above one of the others and below the other.

The name "Borromean rings" comes from their use in the [[coat of arms]] of the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[House of Borromeo|Borromeo]] family in [[Northern Italy]]. The link itself is much older and has appeared in the form of the {{lang|non|''[[valknut]]''}} on [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[image stone]]s dating back to the 7th century.

The Borromean rings have been used in different contexts to indicate strength in unity, e.g., in religion or art. In particular, some have used the design to symbolize the [[Trinity]]. The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] famously found inspiration in the Borromean rings as a model for his topology of human subjectivity, with each ring representing a fundamental Lacanian component of reality (the "real", the "imaginary", and the "symbolic").

The rings were used as the logo of [[Ballantine Brewery|Ballantine beer]], and are still used by the Ballantine brand beer, now distributed by the current brand owner, the  [[Pabst Brewing Company]].<ref>[http://www.liv.ac.uk/~spmr02/rings/beer.html Borromean Logos: Ballantine's Beer]</ref>

In 2006, the [[International Mathematical Union]] decided at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians#List of Congresses|25th International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] to use a new logo based on the Borromean rings.<ref>[http://www.icm2006.org/proceedings/Vol_I/2.pdf ICM 2006]</ref>

A stone pillar at [[Marundeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thiruvanmiyur]], Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, has such a figure dating to before 6th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Volumes/12/05/0041-0047.pdf |title=Borromean Triangles and Prime Knots in an Ancient Temple|author=Arul Lakshminarayan|date=May 2007|work= |publisher=Indian Academy of Sciences |accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://rivr.sulekha.com/beautiful-math-in-pillars-of-an-ancient-chennai-temple_223608_blog Blog entry by Arul Lakshminarayan]</ref>

===Partial rings===
In medieval and renaissance Europe, a number of visual signs are found that consist of three elements interlaced together in the same way that the Borromean rings are shown interlaced (in their conventional two-dimensional depiction), but the individual elements are not closed loops. Examples of such symbols are the [[Snoldelev stone]] horns and the [[Diana of Poitiers]] crescents. An example with three distinct elements is the logo of [[Sport Club Internacional]]. Less-related visual signs include the [[Gankyil]] and the [[Venn diagram]] on three sets.

Similarly, a [[monkey's fist]] knot is essentially a 3-dimensional representation of the Borromean rings, albeit with three layers, in most cases.

Using the pattern in the incomplete Borromean rings, one can balance three knives on three supports, such as three bottles or glasses, providing a support in the middle for a fourth bottle or glass.<ref>[http://www.metacafe.com/watch/943102/knives_and_beer_bar_trick_amazing_balance/ Comments on Knives And Beer Bar Trick: Amazing Balance]</ref>

===Multiple rings===
Some knot-theoretic links contain multiple Borromean rings configurations; one five-loop link of this type is used as a symbol in [[Discordianism]], based on a depiction in the ''[[Principia Discordia]]''.

==Realizations==

[[Molecular Borromean rings]] are the molecular counterparts of Borromean rings, which are [[mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures]]. In 1997, [[biology|biologists]] [[Chengde Mao]] and coworkers of [[New York University]] succeeded in constructing a set of rings from [[DNA]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author = C. Mao, W. Sun & N. C.

A quantum-mechanical analog of Borromean rings is called a halo state or an [[Efimov state]] (the existence of such states was predicted by physicist [[Vitaly Efimov]], in 1970). For the first time the research group of Rudolf Grimm and Hanns-Christoph Nägerl from the Institute for Experimental Physics (University of Innsbruck, Austria) experimentally confirmed such a state in an ultracold gas of caesium atoms in 2006, and published their findings in the scientific journal Nature.<ref>{{cite journal | author = T.
