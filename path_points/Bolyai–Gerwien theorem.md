[[File:Triangledissection.svg|thumb|right|By the Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem, a square can be cut into parts and rearranged into a triangle of equal area.]]

In [[geometry]], the '''Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem''',<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2045399 Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society - Vol. 94, No. 2, Jun., 1985]</ref> named after [[William Wallace (mathematician)|William Wallace]], [[Farkas Bolyai]] and [[Paul Gerwien]], states that any two simple [[polygon]]s of equal [[area]] are ''equidecomposable''; i.e. one can cut the first into [[Finite set|finitely many]] polygonal pieces and rearrange the pieces to obtain the second polygon.

"Rearrangement" means that one may apply a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] and a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] to every polygonal piece. 

Unlike the generalized solution to [[Tarski's circle-squaring problem]], the [[axiom of choice]] is not required for the proof, and the decomposition and reassembly can actually be carried out "physically"; the pieces can, in theory, be [[Jordan curve|cut with scissors]] from paper and reassembled by hand.

The theorem can be understood in two steps. First, every polygon can be cut into triangles: for convex polygons this is immediate, by cutting off each vertex in turn, while for concave polygons this requires more care.  Each of these triangles can then be converted to a right triangle, by dropping an altitude (that is, drawing a line perpendicular to the triangle's base and through the top vertex). This is sufficient to easily compute the area, as each right triangle is half a rectangle, or alternatively can be cut halfway up to be reassembled into a rectangle. The second and subtler step is that each right triangle (or equivalently rectangle) can be decomposed into a rectangle with a side of a given (unit) length. Once this is proven, it follows that every polygon can be decomposed into a rectangle with unit width and height equal to its area, which proves the theorem.

== Higher dimensions ==
The analogous statement about [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] in three dimensions, known as [[Hilbert's third problem]], is false, as proven by [[Max Dehn]] in 1900.

== History ==
[[Farkas Bolyai]] first formulated the question. Gerwien proved the theorem in 1833, but in fact [[William Wallace (mathematician)|Wallace]] had proven the same result already in 1807.

According to other sources, Bolyai and Gerwien had independently proved the theorem in 1833 and 1835, respectively.
