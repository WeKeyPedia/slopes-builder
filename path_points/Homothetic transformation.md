[[Image:Geom podobnost stejnolehlest.svg|thumb|right|334px|Two similar geometric figures related by a homothetic transformation with respect to a [[homothetic center]] '''S'''. The angles at corresponding points are the same and have the same sense; for example, the angles ABC and A'B'C' are both clockwise and equal in magnitude.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''homothety''' (or '''homothecy''', or '''homogeneous dilation''') is a [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] of an [[affine space]] determined by a point ''S'' called its ''center'' and a nonzero number ''λ'' called its ''ratio'', which sends
:<math> M \mapsto S + \lambda \overrightarrow{SM}, </math>
in other words it fixes ''S'', and sends any ''M'' to another point ''N'' such that the segment ''SN'' is on the same line as ''SM'', but scaled by a factor ''λ''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hadamard|p=145}}</ref> In [[Euclidean geometry]] homotheties are the [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]] that fix a point and either preserve (if {{nowrap|''λ'' &gt; 0}}) or reverse (if {{nowrap|''λ'' &lt; 0}}) the direction of all vectors. Together with the [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], all homotheties of an affine (or Euclidean) space form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the group of '''dilations''' or '''homothety-translations'''. These are precisely the [[affine transformation]]s with the property that the image of every line ''L'' is a line [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to ''L''.

In [[projective geometry]], a homothetic transformation is a similarity transformation (i.e., fixes a given elliptic involution) that leaves the line at infinity pointwise [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Tuller|p=119}}</ref>

In Euclidean geometry, a homothety of ratio ''λ'' multiplies distances between points by |''λ''| and all areas by ''λ''<sup>2</sup>.  The first number is called the ''ratio of magnification'' or ''dilation factor'' or ''scale factor'' or ''similitude ratio''. Such a transformation can be called an '''enlargement''' if the scale factor exceeds&nbsp;1. The above-mentioned fixed point ''S'' is called ''[[homothetic center]]'' or ''center of similarity'' or ''center of similitude''

==Homothety and uniform scaling==
If the [[homothetic center]] ''S'' happens to coincide with the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] ''O'' of the vector space (''S'' ≡ ''O''), then every homothety with scale factor ''λ'' is equivalent to a [[uniform scaling]] by the same factor, which sends

:<math> \overrightarrow{OM} \mapsto \lambda \overrightarrow{OM}. </math>

As a consequence, in the specific case in which ''S'' ≡ ''O'', the homothety becomes a [[linear transformation]], which preserves not only the collinearity of points (straight lines are mapped to straight lines), but also vector addition and scalar multiplication.
