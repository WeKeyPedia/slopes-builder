In [[geometry]], a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[point (geometry)|points]] are said to be '''concyclic''' (or '''cocyclic''') if they lie on a common [[circle]]. All concyclic points are the same distance from the [[center (geometry)|center]] of the circle. Three points in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] that do not all fall on a [[straight line]] are concyclic, but four or more such points in the plane are not necessarily concyclic.

==Bisectors==
In general the centre ''O'' of a circle on which points ''P'' and ''Q'' lie must be such that ''OP'' and ''OQ'' are equal distances. Therefore ''O'' must lie on the [[perpendicular bisector]] of the [[line segment]] ''PQ''.<ref>{{citation

===Triangles===

The vertices of every [[triangle]] fall on a circle. (Because of this, some authors define "concyclic" only in the context of four or more points on a circle.)<ref>{{citation

The radius of the circle on which lie a set of points is, by definition, the radius of the circumcircle of any triangle with vertices at any three of those points. If the pairwise distances among three of the points are ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', then the circle's radius is

:<math>R = \sqrt{\frac{a^2b^2c^2}{(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}}.</math>

The equation of the circumcircle of a triangle, and expressions for the radius and the coordinates of the circle's center, in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are given [[Circumscribed circle#Circumcircle equations|here]] and [[Circumscribed circle#Cartesian coordinates|here]].

===Quadrilaterals===

A quadrilateral ''ABCD'' with concyclic vertices is called a [[cyclic quadrilateral]]; this happens if and only if <math>\angle CAD = \angle CBD</math> (the  [[inscribed angle theorem]]) which is true if and only if the opposite angles inside the quadrilateral are [[supplementary angle|supplementary]].<ref>{{citation

By [[Ptolemy's theorem]], if a quadrilateral is given by the pairwise distances between its four vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' in order, then it is cyclic if and only if the product of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of opposite sides: 

: <math>AC \cdot BD = AB \cdot  CD + BC \cdot AD.</math>

If two lines, one  containing segment ''AC'' and the other containing segment ''BD'', intersect at ''X'', then the four points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' are concyclic if and only if<ref>{{citation |last=Bradley |first=Christopher J. |title=The Algebra of Geometry: Cartesian, Areal and Projective Co-Ordinates |publisher=Highperception |year=2007 |isbn=1906338000 |page=179 |oclc=213434422}}</ref>
:<math>\displaystyle AX\cdot XC = BX\cdot XD.</math>

The intersection ''X'' may be internal or external to the circle. This theorem is known as [[power of a point]].

===n-gons===

More generally, a polygon in which all vertices are concyclic is called a [[cyclic polygon]]. A polygon is cyclic if and only if the perpendicular bisectors of its edges are concurrent.<ref>{{citation

==Variations==
Some authors consider [[collinear points]] (sets of points all belonging to a single line) to be a special case of concyclic points, with the line being viewed as a circle of infinite radius. This point of view is helpful, for instance, when studying [[Inversive geometry|inversion through a circle]] and [[Möbius transformation]]s, as these transformations preserve the concyclicity of points only in this extended sense.<ref>{{citation

In the [[complex plane]] (formed by viewing the real and imaginary parts of a [[complex number]] as the ''x'' and ''y'' [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the plane), concyclicity has a particularly simple formulation: four points in the complex plane are either concyclic or collinear if and only if their [[cross-ratio]] is a [[real number]].<ref>{{citation

==Other properties==
A set of five or more points is concyclic if and only if every four-point subset is concyclic.<ref>{{citation

 | year = 1988}}.</ref> This property can be thought of as an analogue for concyclicity of the [[Helly property]] of convex sets.

[[Abouabdillah's theorem]] characterizes the [[similarity transformation (geometry)|similarity transformation]]s of a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension two or more as being the only [[surjective]] mappings of the space to itself that preserve concyclicity.<ref>{{citation|first=D.|last=Abouabdillah|title=Sur les similitudes d'un espace euclidien|journal=Revue de Mathématiques Spéciales|volume=7|year=1991}}.</ref>

==Examples==

===Triangles===

In any triangle all of the following nine points are concyclic on what is called the [[nine-point circle]]: the midpoints of the three edges, the feet of the three altitudes, and the points halfway between the orthocenter and each of the three vertices.

[[Lester's theorem]] states that in any [[scalene triangle]], the two [[Fermat point]]s, the [[nine-point center]], and the [[circumcenter]] are concyclic.

If [[Line (mathematics)|lines]] are drawn through the [[Lemoine point]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the sides of a triangle, then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides of the triangle are concyclic, in what is called the [[Lemoine circle]].

The [[van Lamoen circle]] associated with any given triangle <math>T</math> contains the [[circumcenter]]s of the six triangles that are defined inside <math>T</math> by its three [[median (geometry)|median]]s.

===Other polygons===

A [[polygon]] is defined to be [[cyclic polygon|cyclic]] if its vertices are all concyclic. For example, all the vertices of a [[regular polygon]] of any number of sides are concyclic.

A [[tangential polygon]] is one having an [[inscribed circle]] tangent to each side of the polygon; these tangency points are thus concyclic on the inscribed circle.

A convex quadrilateral is [[orthodiagonal]] (has perpendicular diagonals) if and only if the midpoints of the sides and the feet of the four [[Quadrilateral#Special line segments|maltitudes]] are eight concyclic points, on what is called the '''eight-point circle'''.
