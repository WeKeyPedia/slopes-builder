[[File:Hyperoval in Fano plane.svg|thumb|A 4-arc (red points) in the projective plane of order 2 (Fano plane).]]

A (''simple'') '''arc''' in finite [[projective geometry]] is a set of points which satisfies, in an intuitive way, a feature of ''curved'' figures in [[continuous geometry|continuous geometries]]. Loosely speaking, they are sets of points that are far from "line-like" in a plane or far from "plane-like" in a three-dimensional space. In this finite setting it is typical to include the number of points in the set in the name, so these simple arcs are called '''''k'''''-'''arcs'''. An important generalization of the ''k''-arc concept, also referred to as arcs in the literature, are the (''k'',&nbsp;''d'')-arcs.

==''k''-arcs in a projective plane==

In a finite [[projective plane]] ''&pi;'' (not necessarily [[Desarguesian]]) a set ''A'' of ''k'' (''k'' ≥ 3) points such that no three points of ''A'' are [[Collinear points|collinear]] (on a line) is called a '''''k'''''-'''arc'''. If the plane ''&pi;'' has order ''q'' then ''k'' ≤ ''q'' + 2, however the maximum value of ''k'' can only be achieved if ''q'' is even.<ref>{{harvnb|Hirschfeld|1979|loc=p. 164, Theorem 8.1.3}}</ref> In a plane of order ''q'', a (''q'' + 1)-arc is called an '''[[Oval (projective plane)|oval]]''' and, if ''q'' is even, a (''q'' + 2)-arc is called a '''[[Oval (projective plane)|hyperoval]]'''.

A ''k''-arc which can not be extended to a larger arc is called a '''''complete arc'''''. In the Desarguesian projective planes, PG(2,''q''), no ''q''-arc is complete, so they may all be extended to ovals.<ref>{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 150, result 28}}</ref>

==''k''-arcs in a projective space==

In the finite [[projective space]] PG(''n'', ''q'') with ''n'' ≥ 3, a set ''A'' of ''k'' ≥ ''n'' + 1 points such that no ''n'' + 1  points lie in a common [[Hyperplane (geometry)|hyperplane]] is called a (spacial) '''''k'''''-'''arc'''. This definition generalizes the definition of a ''k''-arc in a plane (where ''n'' = 2).

==(''k'',&nbsp;''d'')-arcs in a projective plane==

A (''k'',&nbsp;''d'')-'''arc''' (''k'',&nbsp;''d''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1) in a finite [[projective plane]] ''&pi;'' (not necessarily [[Desarguesian]]) is a set, ''A'' of ''k'' points of <math>\pi</math> such that each line intersects ''A'' in at most ''d'' points, and there is at least one line that does intersect ''A'' in ''d'' points. A (''k'',&nbsp;2)-arc is a '''''k''-arc''' and may be referred to as simply an '''arc''' if the size is not a concern.

The number of points ''k'' of a (''k'',&nbsp;''d'')-arc ''A'' in a projective plane of order ''q'' is at most ''qd''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''q''.  When equality occurs, one calls ''A'' a '''[[maximal arc]]'''.

Hyperovals are maximal arcs. Complete arcs need not be maximal arcs.
