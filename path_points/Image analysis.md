'''Image analysis''' is the extraction of meaningful information from [[image]]s; mainly from [[digital image]]s by means of [[digital image processing]] techniques.<ref name="solomonbreckon10fundamentals">{{cite book| author=Solomon, C.J., Breckon, T.P.| title=Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing: A Practical Approach with Examples in Matlab|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9780470689776| year=2010| publisher=Wiley-Blackwell| doi=10.1002/9780470689776| isbn=0470844736}}</ref> Image analysis tasks can be as simple as reading [[barcode|bar code]]d tags or as sophisticated as [[facial recognition system|identifying a person from their face]].

[[Computer]]s are indispensable for the analysis of large amounts of data, for tasks that require complex computation, or for the extraction of quantitative information.  On the other hand, the human [[visual cortex]] is an excellent image analysis apparatus, especially for extracting higher-level information, and for many applications &mdash; including medicine, security, and remote sensing &mdash; human analysts still cannot be replaced by computers.  For this reason, many important image analysis tools such as [[edge detection|edge detectors]] and [[neural networks]] are inspired by human [[visual perception]] models.

==Computer Image Analysis==
Computer Image Analysis largely contains the fields of [[computer vision|computer]] or [[machine vision]], and [[medical imaging]], and makes heavy use of [[pattern recognition]], [[digital geometry]], and [[signal processing]].  This field of [[computer science]] developed in the 1950s at academic institutions such as the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] A.I. Lab, originally as a branch of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]].

It is the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] characterization of [[two-dimensional]] (2D) or [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] (3D) [[digital images]]. 2D images are, for example, to be analyzed in [[computer vision]], and 3D images in [[medical imaging]]. The field was established in the 1950s—1970s, for example with pioneering contributions by [[Azriel Rosenfeld]], [[Herbert Freeman]], [[Jack E. Bresenham]], or [[King-Sun Fu]].

==Techniques==
There are many different techniques used in automatically analysing images. Each technique may be useful for a small range of tasks, however there still aren't any known methods of image analysis that are generic enough for wide ranges of tasks, compared to the abilities of a human's image analysing capabilities. Examples of image analysis techniques in different fields include:
* 2D and 3D [[object recognition]],
* [[Segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]], 
* [[motion detection]] e.g. [[Single particle tracking]], 
* [[video tracking]], 
* [[optical flow]], 
* [[Medical imaging|medical scan analysis]], 
* [[3D Pose Estimation]], 
* [[automatic number plate recognition]].

==Digital Image Analysis==
Digital Image Analysis is when a computer or electrical device automatically studies an image to obtain useful information from it. Note that the device is often a computer but may also be an electrical circuit, a digital camera or a mobile phone. The applications of digital image analysis are continuously expanding through all areas of science and industry, including:
*[[medical image processing|medicine]], such as detecting cancer in an MRI scan.
*[[microscope image processing|microscopy]], such as counting the germs in a swab.
*[[remote sensing]], such as detecting intruders in a house, and producing land cover/land use maps.
*[[astronomical image processing|astronomy]], such as calculating the size of a planet.
*[[materials science]], such as determining if a metal weld has cracks. <!-- get a more specific link-->
*[[machine vision]], such as to automatically count items in a factory conveyor belt.
*[[security]], such as detecting a person's eye color or hair color. <!-- get more specific links: fingerprints, face recog, iris, surveillance, license plate-->
*[[robotics]], such as to avoid steering into an obstacle.
*[[optical character recognition]], such as automatic license plate detection.
*[[plate reader|assay micro plate reading]], such as detecting where a chemical was manufactured.
*[[metallography]], such as determining the mineral content of a rock sample.
*[[defense (military)|defense]] 
*[[filtering]] <!-- get a more specific link, and-or examples -->

==Object-based Image Analysis==
Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) – also Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) – "is a sub-discipline of [[geoinformation]] science devoted to (...) partitioning [[remote sensing]] (RS) imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale".<ref>G.J. Hay & G. Castilla: ''Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA): A new name for a new discipline.'' In: T. Blaschke, S. Lang & G. Hay (eds.): Object-Based Image Analysis – Spatial Concepts for Knowledge-Driven Remote Sensing Applications. Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography, 18. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany: 75-89 (2008)</ref>

The two main processes in OBIA are (1) segmentation and (2) classification.  Traditional image segmentation is on a per-pixel basis.  However, OBIA groups pixels into homogeneous objects.  These objects can have different shapes and scale.   Objects also have statistics associated with them which can be used to classify objects.  Statistics can include geometry, context and texture of image objects.  The analyst defines statistics in the classification process to generate [[land cover]]

Each of these application areas has spawned separate subfields of digital image analysis, with a large collection of specialized algorithms and concepts—and with their own journals, conferences, technical societies, and so on.
