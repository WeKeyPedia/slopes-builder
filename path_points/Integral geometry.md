In [[mathematics]], '''integral geometry''' is the theory of [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] on a geometrical space invariant under the [[symmetry group]] of that space.  In more recent times, the meaning has been broadened to include a view of invariant (or [[equivariant]]) transformations from the space of functions on one geometrical space to the space of functions on another geometrical space.  Such transformations often take the form of [[integral transform]]s such as the [[Radon transform]] and its generalizations.

== Classical context ==
Integral geometry as such first emerged as an attempt to refine certain statements of geometric probability theory.  The early work of [[Luis Santaló]] and [[Wilhelm Blaschke]] was in this connection. It follows from the [[Crofton formula|classic theorem of Crofton]] expressing the [[length]] of a plane [[curve]] as an [[expected value|expectation]] of the number of intersections with a [[random]] line.  Here the word 'random' must be interpreted as subject to correct symmetry considerations.

There is a sample space of lines, one on which the [[affine group]] of the plane acts. A [[probability measure]] is sought on this space, invariant under the symmetry group. If, as in this case, we can find a unique such invariant measure, that solves the problem of formulating accurately what 'random line' means; and expectations become integrals with respect to that measure. (Note for example that the phrase 'random chord of a circle' can be used to construct some [[paradox]]es.)

We can therefore say that integral geometry in this sense is the application of [[probability theory]] (as axiomatized by [[Kolmogorov]]) in the context of the [[Erlangen programme]] of Klein. The content of the theory is effectively that of invariant (smooth) measures on (preferably [[Compact space|compact]]) [[homogeneous space]]s of [[Lie group]]s; and the evaluation of integrals of [[differential form]]s arising.

A very celebrated case is the problem of [[Buffon's needle]]: drop a needle on a floor made of planks and calculate the probability the needle lies across a crack. Generalising, this theory is applied to various [[stochastic process]]es concerned with geometric and incidence questions.  See [[stochastic geometry]].

One of the most interesting theorems in this form of integral geometry is [[Hadwiger's theorem]].

The more recent meaning of '''integral geometry''' is that of [[Sigurdur Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurdur Helgason]] and [[Israel Gelfand]]. It deals more specifically with integral transforms, modeled on the [[Radon transform]]. Here the underlying geometrical incidence relation (points lying on lines, in Crofton's case) is seen in a freer light, as the site for an integral transform composed as ''pullback onto the incidence graph'' and then ''push forward''.
