[[Image:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|250px|right|A triangle immersed in a saddle-shape plane (a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]), as well as two diverging ultraparallel lines.]]
In [[mathematics]], '''hyperbolic geometry''' (also called '''[[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevskian]] geometry''' or '''[[János Bolyai|Bolyai]]–Lobachevskian geometry''') is a [[non-Euclidean geometry]], meaning that the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] is replaced.

The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement ([[Playfair's axiom]]) that, in two-dimensional space, for any given line ''R'' and point ''P'' not on ''R'', there is exactly one line through ''P'' that does not intersect ''R''; i.e., that is parallel to ''R''.

In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two distinct lines through ''P'' which do not intersect ''R'', so the parallel postulate is false.

Hyperbolic plane geometry is the geometry of [[saddle surface]]s with a constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]] (for example the [[pseudosphere]])

[[#Models of the hyperbolic plane|Models]] have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry, thus proving that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid.

Because Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry are both consistent and are in an environment with a small [[sectional curvature]] very similar an observer will have a hard time determining whether his environment is Euclidean or hyperbolic. We also cannot decide if our world is Euclidean or hyperbolic.

A modern use of hyperbolic geometry is in the theory of [[special relativity]], particularly [[Minkowski spacetime]] and in [[gyrovector space]].

== History ==

Since the publication of [[Euclid's Elements]] circa 300 BCE, many [[geometers]] made attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]]. A number of them made their attempts to prove the parallel postulate by [[Proof by contradiction| assuming its negation and trying to derive a contradiction]] foremost among these were [[Proclus]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), [[Omar Khayyám]],<ref>See for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.resonancepub.com/omarkhayyam.htm|title=Omar Khayyam 1048–1131|accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref> [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Witelo]], [[Gersonides]], [[Abner of Burgos|Alfonso]], and later [[Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri]], [[John Wallis]], [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]].<ref>
http://www.math.columbia.edu/~pinkham/teaching/seminars/NonEuclidean.html</ref>
Their attempts were doomed to failure (as we now know, the parallel postulate is not provable from the other postulates), but their efforts gave birth to '''hyperbolic geometry'''.

The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam and al-Tusi on [[quadrilateral]]s, including the [[Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral]] and [[Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral]], were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had a considerable influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Gersonides, Alfonso, John Wallis and Saccheri.<ref>Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), "Geometry", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, p. 447–494 [470], [[Routledge]], London and New York: {{quote|"Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam and al-Tusi, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the nineteenth century. In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines – made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the thirteenth century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') – was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the fourteenth century by the Jewish scholar [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gerson]], who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration. Above, we have demonstrated that ''Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid'' had stimulated both J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines."}}</ref>

In the 18th century, [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] introduced the [[hyperbolic functions]]<ref>{{citation|title=Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics|first=Howard|last=Eves|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2012|isbn=9780486132204|page=59|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J9QcmFHj8EwC&pg=PA59|quote=We also owe to Lambert the first systematic development of the theory of hyperbolic functions and, indeed, our present notation for these functions.}}</ref> and computed the area of a [[hyperbolic triangle]].<ref>{{citation|title=Foundations of Hyperbolic Manifolds|volume=149|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=John|last=Ratcliffe|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9780387331973|page=99|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JV9m8o-ok6YC&pg=PA99|quote=That the area of a hyperbolic triangle is proportional to its angle defect first appeared in Lambert's monograph ''Theorie der Parallellinien'', which was published posthumously in 1786.}}</ref>

In the 19th century, hyperbolic geometry was extensively explored by [[János Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]], after whom it sometimes is named. Lobachevsky published in 1830, while Bolyai independently discovered it and published in 1832. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] also studied hyperbolic geometry, describing in an 1824 letter to Taurinus that he had constructed it, but Gauss did not publish his work. Other than their predecessors, who just wanted to eliminate the [[parallel postulate]] from the [[axioms]] of [[euclidean geometry]] Bolyai <ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenberg|first1=Marvin Jay|title=Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries : development and history|date=2003|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=0716724464|page=177|edition=3rd ed.|quote=Out of nothing I have created a strange new universe. JANOS BOLYAI}}</ref> and Lobachevsky realized they had discovered a new geometry.

In 1868, [[Eugenio Beltrami]] provided models of hyperbolic geometry, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent [[if and only if]]  Euclidean geometry was.

The term "hyperbolic geometry" was introduced by [[Felix Klein]] in 1871.<ref>F. Klein, ''Über die sogenannte Nicht-Euklidische'', Geometrie, Math. Ann. 4, 573–625 (cf. Ges. Math. Abh. 1, 244–350).</ref> Klein followed an initiative of [[Arthur Cayley]] to use the transformations of [[projective geometry]] to produce [[isometry|isometries]]. The idea used a [[conic section]] or [[quadric]] to define a region, and  used [[cross ratio]] to define a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] . The projective transformations that leave the conic section or quadric [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]] are the isometries. "Klein showed that if the [[Cayley absolute]] is a real curve then the part of the projective plane in its interior is isometric to the hyperbolic plane..."<ref>Rosenfeld, B.A. (1988) ''A History of Non-Euclidean Geometry'', page 236, Springer-Verlag ISBN 0-387-96458-4 </ref>

==Properties==

[[Image:Hyperbolic.svg|frame|right|Lines through a given point ''P'' and asymptotic to line ''R''.]]

Hyperbolic geometry has many properties that differ from [[Euclidean geometry]].

As mentioned above there are at least  two distinct lines through P which do not intersect R. This means that there are through R an infinite number of non-intersection lines.

These non-intersection lines are divided into two classes:
Two of them (one on each side of B) are [[limiting parallel]] they get asymptoticly closer and closer to R. The other lines are called ultraparallel and will at some point diverge away from R.

The [[limiting parallel]]s  make an angle θ with PB, this angle depends only on the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the plane and the distance  PB and is called the [[angle of parallelism]].

For ultraparallel lines the [[ultraparallel theorem]] states that there is a unique line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each pair of ultraparallel lines.

In Hyperbolic geometry, there is no straight line whose points have the same orthogonal distance from a given straight line. Instead these points are all on a curve called a [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycle]].

An other special curve is the [[horocycle]], a curve whose [[normal (geometry)|normal]] radii are [[limiting parallel]] and all converge asymptotically to the same [[ideal point]].

In Hyperbolic geometry, 3 distinct points lie on either a line, a [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycle]]., a [[horocycle]], or a circle.

=== Circles and disks ===

In hyperbolic geometry, the circumference of a circle of radius ''r'' is greater than 2π''r''. Let <math> R =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}  </math>, where <math> K </math> is the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the plane. The circumference of a circle of radius ''r'' is equal to

:<math>2\pi R \sinh \frac{r}{R} \,.</math>

The area of the enclosed disk is

:<math>2\pi R^2 (\cosh \frac{r}{R} - 1) \,.</math>

=== Triangles ===
{{main| hyperbolic triangle}}

Unlike Euclidean triangles whose angles always add up to 180°. The sum of the angles of a hyperbolic triangle is always strictly less than 180°or  π [[radian]]s. 
The difference is sometimes referred to as the [[Angular defect|defect]].

The area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by its defect in radians multiplied by <math> R^2 </math> where <math> R =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}  </math> and <math> K </math> is the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the plane.

As a consequence all hyperbolic triangles have an area which is less than <math> R^2 \pi </math>. 
The area of a hyperbolic [[ideal triangle]] in which all three angles are 0° is equal to this maximum.

As in [[Euclidean geometry]] each hyperbolic triangle has an [[inscribed circle]].

But if its vertices lie on an [[horocycle]] or [[hypercycle (geometry) |hypercycle]], the triangle has no [[circumscribed circle]].

As in [[spherical geometry]] the only similar triangles are congruent triangles.

=== Standardized Gaussian curvature ===

While in principle hyperbolic geometry is valid on any surface with a constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]] it is usual to model hyperbolic geometry with a curvature <math> K </math> of <math> -1 </math>.

This results that: formula's become simpler, examples: 

The area of a triangle is equal to its angle defect in [[radians]], 

The length of an arc of an [[horocycle]] such that the tangent at one extremity is [[limiting parallel]] to the radius through the other extremity is 1 <ref>{{cite book|last1=Sommerville|first1=D.M.Y.|title=The elements of non-Euclidean geometry|date=2005|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=0-486-44222-5|page=58|edition=Unabr. and unaltered republ.}}</ref>

The ratio of the arclengths between two radii of two [[horocycle]]s where the [[horocycle]]s are a distance 1 apart is [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] : 1.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sommerville|first1=D.M.Y.|title=The elements of non-Euclidean geometry|date=2005|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=0-486-44222-5|page=58|edition=Unabr. and unaltered republ.}}</ref>

== Models of the hyperbolic plane ==

By [[Hilbert's theorem (differential geometry)|Hilbert's theorem]] it is not possible to create a complete hyperbolic plane (a complete regular surface of constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]]) in Euclidean space.

There are different [[pseudospherical surfaces]] that have for a large area a constant negative Gaussian curvature, the [[pseudosphere]] being the best well known of them.

But it is easier to do hyperbolic geometry on other models.

[[Image:Hyperbolic tiling omnitruncated 3-7.png|thumb|250px|Poincaré disc model of [[truncated triheptagonal tiling]]]]
[[Image:Poincare disc hyperbolic parallel lines.svg|thumb|250px|left|Lines through a given point and parallel to a given line, illustrated in the Poincaré disc model]]

{{clear}}

There are four [[Mathematical model|model]]s commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the [[Klein model]], the [[Poincaré disc model]], the [[Poincaré half-plane model]], and the Lorentz model, or [[hyperboloid model]]. These models define a real [[hyperbolic space]] which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry. Despite their names, the first three mentioned above were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by [[Eugenio Beltrami|Beltrami]], not by [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] or [[Felix Klein|Klein]]. All these models generalize to more dimensions.

===The Beltrami - Klein model===

{{main|Beltrami-Klein model}}

The '''[[Beltrami-Klein model]]''', also known as the projective disc model and [[Klein model]], is named after [[Eugenio Beltrami]] and [[Felix Klein]].

This model uses the interior of the [[unit circle]] for the complete hyperbolic [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], and [[chord (geometry)|chords]] of this circle are the hyperbolic lines.

* This model has the advantage that lines are straight, but the disadvantage that [[angle]]s are distorted (the mapping is not [[Conformal map|conformal]]), and also circles are not represented as circles.

* The distance in this model is half the logarithm of the [[cross-ratio]], which was introduced by [[Arthur Cayley]] in [[projective geometry]].

=== The Poincaré disc model ===

{{main|Poincaré disc model}}

The '''[[Poincaré disc model]]''', also known as the conformal disc model, also employs the interior of the [[unit circle]], but lines are represented by arcs of circles that are [[orthogonal]] to the boundary circle, plus diameters of the boundary circle.

* This model preserves hyperbolic angles, and is thereby [[conformal map|conformal]]. All isometries within these models are therefore [[Möbius transformation]]s.

* Circles entirely within the disc remain circles although the Euclidean center of the circle is closer to the center of the disc than the hyperbolic center of the circle.

* [[Horocycle]]s are circles within the disc which are [[tangent]] to the boundary circle, minus the point of contact.

* [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]] are open-ended chords and circular arcs within the disc that terminate on the boundary circle at non-orthogonal angles.

=== The Poincaré half-plane  model===

{{main|Poincaré half-plane model}}

The '''[[Poincaré half-plane model]]''' takes one-half of the Euclidean plane, as determined by a Euclidean line ''B'', to be the hyperbolic plane (''B'' itself is not included).

* Hyperbolic lines are then either half-circles orthogonal to ''B'' or rays perpendicular to ''B''.

* Both Poincaré models preserve hyperbolic angles, and are thereby [[conformal map|conformal]]. All isometries within these models are therefore [[Möbius transformation]]s.

* The half-plane model is the limit of Poincaré disc models whose boundary is tangent to ''B'' at the same point while the radius of the disc model goes to infinity.

=== The hyperboloid model===

{{main|hyperboloid model}}

The '''[[hyperboloid model]]''' or '''Lorentz model'''  employs a 2-dimensional [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (of two sheets, but using one) embedded in 3-dimensional [[Minkowski space]]. This model is generally credited to Poincaré, but Reynolds (see reference) says that [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]] used this model from 1872.<ref>{{aut|Reynolds, William F.}}, (1993) ''Hyperbolic Geometry on a Hyperboloid'', [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 100:442–455.</ref> 

*This model has direct application to [[special relativity]], as Minkowski 3-space is a model for [[spacetime]], suppressing one spatial dimension. One can take the hyperboloid to represent the events that various moving observers, radiating outward in a spatial plane from a single point, will reach in a fixed [[proper time]]. 

*The hyperbolic distance between two points on the hyperboloid can then be identified with the relative [[rapidity]] between the two corresponding observers. 

*The model generalizes directly to an additional dimension, where three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry relates to Minkowski 4-space.

===Other models of the hyperbolic plane===

====The hemispherical model ====

The [[hemisphere|hemispherical]] model is not often used as model by itself, but it functions as an useful tool for visualising transformations between the other models.

The hemispherical model uses the upper half of the [[sphere]]:
<math> x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 1 , z > 0 </math>

The hemisphere model is part of an [[Riemann sphere]], and different projections give different models of the hyperbolic plane:

* [[Stereographic projection]] from  <math> (0,0, -1) </math> onto the plane <math> z = 0 </math>  projects corresponding points on the [[Poincaré disk model]]

* [[Stereographic projection]] from  <math> (0,0, -1) </math> onto the surface <math> x^2 + y^2 - z^2  = -1 , z > 0  </math>  projects corresponding points on the [[hyperboloid model]]

* [[stereographic projection]] from a point on the XY-plane onto a plane perpendicular to the diameter trough that point projects corresponding points on the [[Poincaré half-plane model]]

* [[Orthographic projection]] onto a plane <math> z = C </math> projects corresponding points on the [[Beltrami-Klein model]]. 

* [[Central projection]] from the centre of the sphere onto the plane <math> z = 1 </math> projects corresponding points on the [[Gans Model]]

See further: [[ #Connection between the models | Connection between the models (below)]]

==== The Gans Model ====
The '''[[Gans model]]''' or '''[[flattened hyperboloid model]]'''
In 1966 David Gans proposed this model in the journal [[American Mathematical Monthly]] <ref>[Gans David (1966). A New Model of the Hyperbolic Plane. American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 73, Issue 3, March 1966.</ref> It is an [[orthographic projection]] of the hyperboloid model onto the xy-plane.
This model is not as widely used as other models but nevertheless is quite useful in the understanding of hyperbolic geometry.
*Unlike the Klein or the Poincaré models, this model utilizes the entire [[Euclidean plane]].
*The lines in this model are interpreted as the branches of a [[hyperbola]].<ref>http://www.d.umn.edu/cs/thesis/kedar_bhumkar_ms.pdf</ref>

===Connection between the models===
:::[[File:Relation5models.png|250px|thumb|right|Poincaré disk, hemispherical and hyperboloid models are related by [[stereographic projection]] from &minus;1. [[Beltrami-Klein  model]] is [[orthographic projection]] from hemispheric model. [[Poincaré half-plane model]] here projected from the hemisphere model by rays from left end of Poincaré disk model.]]

All models essentially describe the same structure. The difference between them is that they represent different [[Atlas (topology)|coordinate charts]] laid down on the same [[metric space]], namely the [[hyperbolic space]]. The characteristic feature of the hyperbolic space itself is that it has a constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]], which is indifferent to the coordinate chart used.  The [[geodesic]]s are similarly invariant: that is, geodesics map to geodesics under coordinate transformation. Hyperbolic geometry generally is introduced in terms of the geodesics and their intersections on the hyperbolic space.<ref>Arlan Ramsay, Robert D. Richtmyer, ''Introduction to Hyperbolic Geometry'', Springer; 1 edition (December 16, 1995)</ref>

Once we choose a coordinate chart (one of the "models"), we can always [[Immersion (mathematics)|embed]] it in a Euclidean space of same dimension, but the embedding is clearly not isometric (since the curvature of Euclidean space is 0). The hyperbolic space can be represented by infinitely many different charts; but the embeddings in Euclidean space due to these four specific charts show some interesting characteristics.

Since the four models describe the same metric space, each can be transformed into the other. 

See, for example:

* [[Beltrami–Klein model#Relation to the hyperboloid model|the Beltrami–Klein model's relation to the hyperboloid model]],
* [[Beltrami–Klein model#Relation to the Poincaré disk model|the Beltrami–Klein model's relation to the Poincaré disk model]], 
* and [[Poincaré disk model#Relation to the hyperboloid model|the Poincaré disk model's relation to the hyperboloid model]].

== Visualizing hyperbolic geometry ==

[[Image:Escher Circle Limit III.jpg|thumb|250px|[[M.C. Escher]]'s ''[[Circle Limit III]]'', 1959]]

[[M. C. Escher]]'s famous prints ''[[Circle Limit III]]'' and [http://mcescher.com/Gallery/recogn-bmp/LW436.jpg ''Circle Limit IV'']
illustrate the conformal disc model ([[Poincaré disk model]]) quite well. The white lines in ''III'' are not quite geodesics (they are [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]]), but are quite close to them. It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative [[curvature]] of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares.

For example, in ''Circle Limit III'' every vertex belongs to three triangles and three squares. In the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450°; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180°. Another visible property is [[exponential growth]]. In ''Circle Limit III'', for example, one can see that the number of fishes within a distance of ''n'' from the center rises exponentially. The fishes have equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius ''n'' must rise exponentially in ''n''.

There are several ways to physically realize a hyperbolic plane (or approximation thereof). A particularly well-known paper model based on the [[pseudosphere]] is due to [[William Thurston]]. The art of [[crochet]] has [[Mathematics and fiber arts#Knitting and crochet|been used]] to demonstrate hyperbolic planes with the first being made by [[Daina Taimina]],<ref>{{cite web | date = December 21, 2006 | url = http://theiff.org/oexhibits/oe1e.html | title = Hyperbolic Space | work = The Institute for Figuring | accessdate = January 15, 2007}}</ref> whose book ''Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes'' won the 2009 [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Homogeneous structure==
[[Hyperbolic space]] of dimension n is a special case of a Riemannian [[symmetric space]] of noncompact type, as it is isomorphic to the quotient 
:: <math>O(1,n)/(O(1) \times O(n)).</math>
The [[orthogonal group]] O(1,n) acts by norm-preserving transformations on [[Minkowski space]] '''R'''<sup>1,''n''</sup>, and it acts transitively on the two-sheet hyperboloid of norm 1 vectors.  Timelike lines (i.e., those with positive-norm tangents) through the origin pass through antipodal points in the hyperboloid, so the space of such lines yields a model of hyperbolic ''n''-space.  The stabilizer of any particular line is isomorphic to the product of the orthogonal groups O(n) and O(1), where O(n) acts on the tangent space of a point in the hyperboloid, and O(1) reflects the line through the origin.  Many of the elementary concepts in hyperbolic geometry can be described in linear algebraic terms: geodesic paths are described by intersections with planes through the origin, dihedral angles between hyperplanes can be described by inner products of normal vectors, and hyperbolic reflection groups can be given explicit matrix realizations.

In small dimensions, there are exceptional isomorphisms of Lie groups that yield additional ways to consider symmetries of hyperbolic spaces.  For example, in dimension 2, the isomorphisms SO<sup>+</sup>(1,2) ≅ PSL(2,'''R''') ≅ PSU(1,1) allow one to interpret the upper half plane model as the quotient SL(2,'''R''')/SO(2) and the Poincaré disc model as the quotient SU(1,1)/U(1).  In both cases, the symmetry groups act by fractional linear transformations, since both groups are the orientation-preserving stabilizers in PGL(2,'''C''') of the respective subspaces of the Riemann sphere.  The Cayley transformation not only takes one model of the hyperbolic plane to the other, but realizes the isomorphism of symmetry groups as conjugation in a larger group.  In dimension 3, the fractional linear action of PGL(2,'''C''') on the Riemann sphere is identified with the action on the conformal boundary of hyperbolic 3-space induced by the isomorphism O<sup>+</sup>(1,3) ≅ PGL(2,'''C'''). This allows one to study isometries of hyperbolic 3-space by considering spectral properties of representative complex matrices.  For example, parabolic transformations are conjugate to rigid translations in the upper half-space model, and they are exactly those transformations that can be represented by unipotent upper triangular matrices.
