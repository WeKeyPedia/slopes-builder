In [[geometry]], '''Pedoe's inequality''', named after [[Daniel Pedoe]], states that if ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are the lengths of the sides of a [[triangle]] with area ''&fnof;'', and ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are the lengths of the sides of a triangle with area  ''F'', then

:<math>A^2(b^2+c^2-a^2)+B^2(a^2+c^2-b^2)+C^2(a^2+b^2-c^2)\geq 16Ff,\,</math>

with equality [[if and only if]] the two triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]].

The expression on the left is not only symmetric under any of the six permutations of the set {&nbsp;(''A'',&nbsp;''a''),&nbsp;(''B'',&nbsp;''b''),&nbsp;(''C'',&nbsp;''c'')&nbsp;} of pairs, but also&mdash;perhaps not so obviously&mdash;remains the same if ''a'' is interchanged with ''A'' and ''b'' with ''B'' and ''c'' with&nbsp;''C''.  In other words, it is a symmetric function of the pair of triangles.

Pedoe's inequality is a generalization of [[Weitzenböck's inequality]] and of the [[Hadwiger–Finsler inequality]].
