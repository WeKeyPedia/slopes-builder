In [[plane geometry]], '''Holditch's theorem''' states that if a [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of fixed length is allowed to rotate inside a convex closed curve, then the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of a point on the chord a distance ''p'' from one end and a distance ''q'' from the other is a closed curve whose area is less than that of the original curve by <math>\pi pq</math>. The theorem was published in 1858 by Rev. [[Hamnet Holditch]].<ref name=Pickover/><ref>Holditch, Rev. Hamnet, "Geometrical theorem", ''[[The Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'' 2, 1858, p. 38.</ref> While not mentioned by Holditch, the proof of the theorem requires an assumption that the chord be short enough that the traced locus is a simple closed curve.<ref name=Broman>[[Arne Broman|Broman, Arne]], [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2689793 "A fresh look at a long-forgotten theorem"], ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'' 54(3), May 1981, 99–108.</ref>

==Observations==
The theorem is included as one of [[Clifford Pickover]]'s 250 milestones in the history of mathematics.<ref name=Pickover>{{citation |last=Pickover|first=Clifford|title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |publisher=Sterling |date=1 September 2009|page=250 |isbn = 978-1-4027-5796-9}}</ref> Some peculiarities of the theorem include that the area formula <math>\pi pq</math> is independent of both the shape and the size of the original curve, and that the area formula is the same as for that of the area of an [[ellipse]] with semi-axes ''p'' and ''q''.  The theorem's author was a president of [[Caius College, Cambridge]].

==Extensions==

Broman<ref name=Broman/> gives a more precise statement of the theorem, along with a generalization. The generalization allows, for example, consideration of the case in which the outer curve is a [[triangle]], so that the conditions of the precise statement of Holditch's theorem do not hold because the paths of the endpoints of the chord have [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] portions (portions that retrace themselves) whenever an [[acute angle]] is traversed. Nevertheless, the generalization shows that if the chord is shorter than any of the triangle's [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]]s, and is short enough that the traced locus is a simple curve, Holditch's formula for the in-between area is still correct (and remains so if the triangle is replaced by any [[convex polygon]] with a short enough chord). However, other cases result in different formulas.
