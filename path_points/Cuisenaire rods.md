Cuisenaire rods were devised in the 1920s by the wife of Georges Cuisenaire, a [[Belgian]] educator.<ref name= "alive">{{Citation |author=Lila Das Gupta |publication-date=April 15, 2006 |title=Turning the tide on times tables Cuisenaire rods make maths come alive |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |page=11 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3352968/Turning-the-tide-on-times-tables.html |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> Similar to how written musical notes make music visible, Cuisenaire rods were designed to make mathematics visible by using wood rods of varying lengths and colour.<ref name= "beginning">{{Citation |author=Chris Sheedy |publication-date=November 30, 2008 |title=Icons in the beginning... |work= [[The Sun-Herald]] |page=10 |url=http://www.subtraction.com.au/subtraction-articles/2008/11/30/icons-in-the-beginning/ |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> By 1931, the Cuisenaire rods, which were then known as réglettes,<ref>{{Citation |author=[[John Robert Cartwright]] |publication-date=December 20, 1968 |title=Cuisenaire v.

== Overview ==
The educationalists [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Friedrich Fröbel]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Froebel Web |url=http://www.froebelweb.org/web2026.html |title=Georges Cuisenaire created numbers in color |publisher=Froebelweb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> had used rods to represent numbers, but it was Cuisenaire who introduced their use to teachers across the world from the 1950s onwards. He published a book on their use in 1952 called ''Les nombres en couleurs.'' Cuisenaire, a violin player, taught music as well as arithmetic in the primary school in [[Thuin]]. He wondered why children found it easy and enjoyable to pick up a tune and yet found mathematics neither easy nor enjoyable. These comparisons with music and its representation led Cuisenaire to experiment in 1931 with a set of ten rods sawn out of wood, with lengths from 1&nbsp;cm to 10&nbsp;cm. He painted each length of rod a different colour and began to use these in his teaching of arithmetic. The invention remained almost unknown outside the village of Thuin for about 23 years, until Gattegno came to visit him and observe lessons in 1953. With Gattegno's help, the use of the rods for both mathematics and language teaching was developed and popularised in many countries around the world.

According to Gattegno, "Georges Cuisenaire showed in the early fifties that students who had been taught traditionally, and were rated ‘weak’, took huge strides when they shifted to using the (Cuisenaire) material. They became 'very good' at traditional arithmetic when they were allowed to manipulate the rods."<ref>{{cite book|last=Gattegno|first=Caleb|title=The Science of Education Part 2B: the Awareness of Mathematization|isbn=978-0878252084}}</ref>

== The Silent Way ==
Though primarily used for mathematics, they have also become popular in [[foreign language teaching|language-teaching]] classrooms, particularly [[The Silent Way]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uneeducationpourdemain.org/en/pedagogical-articles/silent-way/234-some-silent-way-exercises-for-beginners-using-cuisenaire-rods-glenys-hanson |title=Some Silent Way exercises for beginners using Cuisenaire rods - Glenys Hanson |publisher=Uneeducationpourdemain.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> They can be used
# to demonstrate most grammatical structures such as [[preposition]]s of place, comparatives & superlatives, determiners, tenses, adverbs of time, manner, etc.,
# to show sentence and [[word stress]], rising and falling intonation and word groupings,
# to create a visual model of constructs, for example the English verb tense system <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uneeducationpourdemain.org/en/pedagogical-articles/silent-way/231-the-english-verb-tense-system-a-dynamic-presentation-using-the-cuisenaire-rods-glenys-hanson |title=The English Verb Tense System: a dynamic presentation using the Cuisenaire Rods - Glenys Hanson |publisher=Uneeducationpourdemain.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>
# to represent physical objects: clocks, floor-plans, maps, people, animals, fruit, tools, etc. which can lead to the creation of stories told by the students as in this video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvb2VFUKQv4 |title=Silent Way: rods, describing a scene (part 6 of 8) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-11 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>

== Other coloured rods ==
In her first school, and in schools since then, [[Maria Montessori]] used coloured rods in the classroom to teach concepts of both mathematics and length. This is possibly the first instance of coloured rods being used in the classroom for this purpose.

[[Catherine Stern]] also devised a set of coloured rods produced by staining wood with aesthetically pleasing colours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sternmath.com/ |title=http |publisher=//www.sternmath.com/ |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sternmath.com/who-we-are.html |title=Catherine Stern on |publisher=Sternmath.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>

In 1961 [[Seton Pollock]] produced the [[Colour Factor]] system,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloracademy.co.uk/ColorAcademy%202006/subjects/mathematics/mathematics.htm |title=Mathematics|publisher=ColorAcademy |year=2004 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}(brief overview of the history of Colour Factor)</ref> consisting of rods from lengths 1 to 12&nbsp;cm. The odd-numbered lengths have cold colours, and the even-numbered lengths have warm colours.
