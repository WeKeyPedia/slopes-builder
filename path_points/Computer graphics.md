'''Computer graphics''' are [[pictures]] and [[movie]]s created using [[computer]]s  - usually referring to [[image]] data created by a computer specifically with help from specialized graphic hardware and software.  It is a subset of [[computer science]] and a recent field.  The phrase was coined by computer graphics researcher [[William Fetter]] of [[Boeing]] in 1960.  Another name for the field is [[computer-generated imagery]], or simply '''CGI'''.

Important topics in computer graphics include [[sprite (graphics)|sprite graphics]], [[vector graphics]], [[3D modeling]],  [[shader]]s, [[GPU]] design, and [[computer vision]], among others.   The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of [[geometry]], [[optics]], and [[physics]].  Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and beautifully to the user, and processing image data received from the physical world.  The interaction and understanding of computers and interpretation of data has been made easier because of computer graphics. Computer graphic development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized [[animation]], [[movies]], [[advertising]], [[video game]]s, and [[graphic design]] generally.

== Overview ==
The term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe "almost everything on computers that is not text or sound".<ref>[http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/tutorial/ What is Computer Graphics?],
Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics. Last updated 04/15/98. Accessed November 17, 2009.</ref> Typically, the term ''computer graphics'' refers to several different things:
* the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer
* the various [[technologies]] used to create and manipulate images
* the sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content, see [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]]

Computer graphics is widespread today. Computer imagery is found on television, in newspapers, for example in weather reports, or for example in all kinds of medical investigation and surgical procedures. A well-constructed [[Chart|graph]] can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret. In the media "such graphs are used to illustrate papers, reports, thesis", and other presentation material.<ref>University of Leeds ISS (2002). [http://iss.leeds.ac.uk/info/306/giraphics/215/overview_of_computer_graphics/2 "What are computer graphics?"]. Last updated: 22 September 2008</ref>

Many powerful tools have been developed to visualize data. Computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types: two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D), and animated graphics. As technology has improved, [[3D computer graphics]] have become more common, but [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used. Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Over the past decade, other specialized fields have been developed like [[information visualization]], and [[scientific visualization]] more concerned with "the visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, [[Biological Data Visualization|biological]], etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component".<ref name = "MF08">[[Michael Friendly]] (2008).

== History ==

{{See also|History of computer animation|}}

==Introduction==
The precursor sciences to the development of modern computer graphics were the advances in [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], and [[television]] that took place during the first half of the twentieth century.  Screens could display art since the [[Lumiere brothers]]' use of [[matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive.   The [[oscilloscope]] and the military [[control panel]] would prove to be the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input.  

=== 1950s ===
[[File:SAGE control room.png|thumb|right|[[SAGE Project|SAGE]] Sector Control Room.]]
Early projects like the [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] and [[SAGE Project]]s introduced the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] as a viable [[visual display unit|display]] and interaction interface and introduced the [[light pen]] as an [[input device]].  [[Douglas T. Ross]] of  the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in 1954 in which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope.  One of the first interactive [[Tennis For Two|videogames]] to feature recognizable, interactive graphics was created for an oscilloscope by [[William Higinbotham]] to entertain visitors in 1958 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and simulated a tennis match.  In 1959, [[Douglas T. Ross]] innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated machine tool vectors, and took the opportunity to create a display scope image of a [[Disney]] [[cartoon]] character.<ref>John Francis Reintjes and [[Douglas T. Ross]] [http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/10783-automatically-programmed-tools-1959-science-reporter-tv-series "Automatically Programmed Tools" (1959)] Science Reporter TV Series</ref>

The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware.  Further advances in computing led to greater advancements in [[interactive computer graphics]]. In 1959, the [[TX-2]] computer was developed at [[Lincoln Laboratory|MIT's Lincoln Laboratory]]. The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces. A [[light pen]] could be used to draw sketches on the computer using [[Ivan Sutherland]]'s revolutionary [[Sketchpad|Sketchpad software]].<ref name= "WC03"/> Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small [[photoelectric cell]] in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen's [[electron gun]] fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location.  Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.

=== 1960s ===
[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|thumb|[[Spacewar!]] running on the [[Computer History Museum]]'s [[PDP-1]]]]
The phrase “computer graphics” itself was coined in 1960 by [[William Fetter]], a graphic designer for [[Boeing]].<ref name= "WC03">Wayne Carlson (2003) [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation]. [[Ohio State University]]</ref> 
In 1961 another student at MIT, [[Steve Russell]], created the second video game, ''[[Spacewar!|Spacewar]]''. Written for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-1]], Spacewar was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually DEC got a copy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The engineers at DEC used it as a diagnostic program on every new PDP-1 before shipping it. The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the world's first video game for their new customers.  

E. E. Zajac, a scientist at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratory]] (BTL), created a film called "Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system" in 1963.<ref>David Salomon (1999). ''Computer graphics and geometric modeling''. p. ix</ref> In this computer-generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth. He created the animation on an [[IBM 7090]] mainframe computer. Also at BTL, [[Ken Knowlton]], [[Frank Sinden]] and [[Michael Noll]] started working in the computer graphics field. Sinden created a film called [http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/8/20/AT&T-Archives-Force-Mass-Motion ''Force, Mass and Motion''] illustrating [[Newton's laws of motion]] in operation. Around the same time, other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research. At [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]], Nelson Max created the films ''Flow of a Viscous Fluid'' and ''Propagation of Shock Waves in a Solid Form''. [[Boeing Aircraft]] created a film called ''Vibration of an Aircraft''.

Also sometime in the early 1960's, [[automobile]]s would also provide a boost through the early work of [[Pierre Bézier]] at [[Renault]], who used [[Paul de Casteljau]]'s curves - now called [[Bézier curve]]s after Bézier's work in the field - to develop 3d modeling techniques for [[Renault]] car bodies.  These curves would form the foundation for much curve-modeling work in the field, as curves - unlike polygons - are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well.

It was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics. [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed-Georgia]], [[General Electric]] and [[Sperry Rand]] are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the [[IBM 2250]] graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer.  [[Ralph Baer]], a supervising engineer at [[Sanders Associates]], came up with a home [[video game]] in 1966 that was later licensed to [[Magnavox]] and called the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. [[David C. Evans]] was director of engineering at [[Bendix Corporation]]'s computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the [[University of Utah]] recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics.

Also in 1966, [[Ivan Sutherland]] continued to innovate at MIT invented the first computer controlled [[head-mounted display]] (HMD). Called the Sword of Damocles because of the hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in [[stereoscopic 3D]]. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at [[DARPA|ARPA]] (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard.  In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the [[University of Utah]]. There he perfected his HMD. Twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their [[virtual reality]] research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.  In 1969, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] initiated A Special Interest Group on Graphics ([[SIGGRAPH]]) which organizes [[List of computer science conferences#Computer graphics|conferences]], [[graphics standards]], and publications within the field of computer graphics. In 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization. SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time.

=== 1970s ===
[[File:utah teapot.png|250px|thumb|right|The [[Utah teapot]] by [[Martin Newell (computer scientist)|Martin Newell]] and its static renders became emblematic of CGI development during the 1970s.]]
Many of the most important early breakthroughs in the transformation of graphics from utilitarian to realistic occurred at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s. A student by the name of [[Edwin Catmull]] started at the University of Utah in 1970 and signed up for [[Ivan Sutherland]]'s computer graphics class. Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and had been working on his degree in physics. Growing up on [[Disney]], Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution. The first animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics. In the same class, [[Fred Parke]] created an animation of his wife's face. Because of Evan's and Sutherland's presence, UU was gaining quite a reputation as the place to be for computer graphics research so Catmull went there to learn 3D animation.

As the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, [[John Warnock]] was one of those early pioneers; he would later found [[Adobe Systems]] and create a revolution in the publishing world with his [[PostScript]] page description language. Tom Stockham led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab. Jim Clark was also there; he would later found Silicon Graphics, Inc.  The first major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers, the hidden-surface algorithm. In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are "behind" the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be "hidden" when the computer creates (or renders) the image.  The [[3D Core Graphics System]] (or '''Core''') was the first graphical standard to be developed.  A group of 25 experts of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Special Interest Group]] [[SIGGRAPH]] developed this "conceptual framework".  The specifications were published in 1977, and it became a foundation for many future development in the field.

Also in the 1970s, [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]], [[Jim Blinn]] and [[Bui Tuong Phong]] contributed to the foundations of [[shading]] in CGI via the development of the [[Gouraud shading]] and [[Blinn-Phong shading]] models, allowing graphics to move beyond a "flat" look to a look more accurately portraying depth.  [[Jim Blinn]] also innovated further in 1978 by introducing [[bump mapping]], a technique for simulating uneven surfaces, and the predecessor to many more advanced kinds of mapping used today.

The modern [[videogame]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] as is known today was birthed in the 1970's, with the first arcade games using [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] graphics.  ''[[Pong]]'' in 1972 was one of the first hit arcade cabinet games. ''[[Speed Race]]'' in 1974 featured sprites moving along a vertically [[scrolling]] road. ''[[Gun Fight]]'' in 1975 featured human-looking sprite character graphics, while ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1978 featured a large number of sprites on screen; both used an [[Intel 8080]] [[microprocessor]] and [[Fujitsu]] MB14241 [[Video display controller|video shifter]] to [[Graphics processing unit|accelerate]] the drawing of sprite graphics.

=== 1980s ===
[[File:Money for Nothing Music Video.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Dire Straits]]' [[1985]] [[music video]] for their hit song [[Money for Nothing (song)|Money For Nothing]] - the "I Want My [[MTV]]" song – became known as an early example of fully three-dimensional, [[animation|animated]] computer-generated imagery.]]
The 1980s began to see the modernization and commercialization of computer graphics.  As the [[home computer]] proliferated, a subject which had previously been an academics-only discipline was adopted by a much larger audience, and the number of computer graphics developers increased significantly.

In the early 1980s, the availability of [[Bit plane|bit-slice]] and [[16-bit]] microprocessors started to revolutionise high-resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations. Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and [[mini-computers]]. Typical of the early move to high resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from [[Bell-Northern Research]], and led by [[David Pearson, Computer Scientist|David Pearson]], an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD bit-slice processors and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods. In the late 1980s, [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated [[short film]]s at [[Pixar]]. The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of [[multimedia]] technology. 

[[File:Quarxs-Affiche.jpg|thumb|175px|''Quarxs'', series poster, [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[François Schuiten]], 1992]]
[[Japan]]'s [[Osaka University]] developed the [[Supercomputing in Japan|LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System]], a [[supercomputer]] that used up to 257 [[Zilog Z8000|Zilog Z8001]] [[microprocessor]]s, in 1982, for the purpose of rendering realistic [[3D computer graphics]]. According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: "The core of 3D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, [[Computer graphics lighting|light source]], and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images. It was used to create the world's first 3D [[planetarium]]-like video of the entire [[Universe|heavens]] that was made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the [[Fujitsu]] pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]]."<ref>http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/other/0013.html</ref> The LINKS-1 was the world's most powerful [[computer]], as of 1984.<ref>http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VideogameImpact.pdf#page=29</ref>    In 1988, the first [[shader]]s - small programs designed specifically do to [[shading]] as a separate algorithm - were developed by [[Pixar]].

The 1980's is also called the [[golden era]] of [[videogames]];  millions-selling systems from [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]], among other companies, exposed computer graphics for the first time to a new, young, and impressionable audience - as did [[MS-DOS]]-based personal computers, [[Apple II]]s and [[Macintosh computers|Macs]], and [[Amiga]]s, which also allowed users to program their own games if skilled enough.  [[Demoscene]]s and [[shareware]] games proliferated;  [[John Carmack]], a later 3D innovator, would start out in this period developing sprite-based games. In the [[Arcade game|arcades]], advances were made in commercial, [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] 3D graphics. In 1988, the first dedicated real-time 3D [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] [[Graphics card|graphics boards]] were introduced in arcades, with the [[Namco System 21]]<ref>http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=536</ref> and [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] Air System.<ref>http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=656</ref>

=== 1990s ===
The 1990s began to see the first rendered graphics that could truly pass as [[photorealistic]] to the untrained eye (though they could not yet do so with a trained CGI artist) and [[3D graphics]] became far more popular in [[Video game|gaming]], [[multimedia]] and [[animation]]. At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: ''La Vie des bêtes'' by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), ''Les Fables Géométriques'' (1989-1991) by studio Fantôme, and ''[[Quarxs]]'', the first  HDTV computer graphics series by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[François Schuiten]] (studio Z-A production, 1990–1993).

In 1992, ''[[Virtua Racing]]'', running on the [[Sega Model 1]] [[arcade system board]], laid the foundations for fully 3D [[racing game]]s and popularized real-time [[3D computer graphics|3D polygonal graphics]] among a wider audience in the [[video game industry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Virtua Racing – Arcade (1992)|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100412225953/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html|work=15 Most Influential Games of All Time|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=14 March 2001}}</ref> The [[Sega Model 2]] in 1993 and [[Sega Model 3]] in 1996 subsequently pushed the boundaries of commercial, real-time 3D graphics. In 1995, ''[[Toy Story]]'', the first full-length computer-generated animation film, was released in cinemas worldwide. In 1996, ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', one of the first fully 3D [[first-person shooter]] games, was released by [[id Software]] using a rendering engine innovated primarily by [[John Carmack]].  Also in 1996, Krishnamurty and Levoy invented [[normal mapping]] - an improvement on Jim Blinn's [[bump mapping]].

[[Pixar]] began its serious commercial rise in this era under [[Edwin Catmull]], with its first major film release, in 1995 - [[Toy Story]] - a critical and commercial success of nine-figure magnitude.  The studio to invent the programmable [[shader]] would go on to have many animated hits, and its work on prerendered video animation is still considered an industry leader and research trailbreaker.

1999 saw [[Nvidia]] release the seminal [[GeForce 256]], the first home [[video card]] billed as a [[graphics processing unit]] or GPU, which in its own words contained "integrated [[linear transformation|transform]], [[lighting]], [[triangle]] setup/[[clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]], and [[3d rendering|rendering]] engines".  By the end of the decade, computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such as [[DirectX]] and [[OpenGL]]. Since then, computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic, due to more powerful [[graphics hardware]] and [[3D modeling software]].

=== 2000s ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:Akiross.jpg|thumb|200px|Still from [[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]], 2001]]

[[Video games]] and CGI [[film|cinema]] spread the reach of computer graphics to the mainstream by the late 1990s, and continued to do so at an accelerated pace in the 2000s. CGI was also adopted ''en masse'' for [[television advertisement]]s in this era, and so became familiar to a massive audience.  The rise of the graphics processing unit was crucial to this decade, and 3D rendering capabilities became a standard feature on even inexpensive hardware as 3D-graphics [[GPU]]s became considered a necessity for [[desktop computer]] makers to offer. [[Shader]]s which had been introduced in the 1980s to perform specialized processing on the GPU would by the end of the decade become supported on most consumer hardware, speeding up graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[shading]] in computer graphics via the widespread adoption of [[normal mapping]], [[bump mapping]], and a variety of other techniques allowing the simulation of a great amount of detail.

Computer graphics used in films and [[video games]] gradually began to be realistic to the point of entering the [[uncanny valley]]. ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use photorealistic CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997597,00.html ''Cinema: A Painstaking Fantasy''] Chris Taylor, Time, 31 July 2000 (retrieved 8 August 2012).</ref> The film was not a box-office success.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=finalfantasy.htm ''Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within''] at Box Office Mojo (retrieved 12 August 2012).</ref> Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the "uncanny valley".<ref>The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The concept "valley" refers to the dip in a graph of the comfort level of humans as a function of a robot's human likeness.</ref> Other examples include several later ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games, and other animated films like ''[[The Polar Express]]''.

In [[scientific computing]], the [[GPGPU]] technique to pass large amounts of data [[bidirectional]]ly between a GPU and CPU was invented;  speeding up analysis on many kinds of [[bioinformatics]] and [[molecular biology]] experiments.  The technique has also been used for [[Bitcoin]] mining and has applications in [[computer vision]].

=== 2010s ===
[[File:Titanfall box art.jpg|thumb|200px|Box art from [[Titanfall]], 2014]]
{{Expand section|date=October 2014}}

In the early half of the 2010s, CGI is nearly ubiquitous in video, pre-rendered graphics are nearly scientifically [[photorealistic]], and realtime graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye. [[Texture mapping]] has matured into a multistage process with many layers;  generally it is not uncommon to implement texture mapping, [[bump mapping]] or [[isosurface]]s, [[normal mapping]], lighting maps including [[specular highlight]]s and [[reflection]] techniques, and [[shadow volume]]s into one rendering engine using [[shader]]s, which are maturing considerably.  Shaders are now very nearly a necessity for advanced work in the field, providing considerable complexity in manipulating [[pixels]], [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertices]], and [[Texture (visual arts)|textures]] on a per-element basis, and countless possible effects.  Their shader languages [[HLSL]] and [[GLSL]] are active fields of research and development.   Experiments into the processing power required to provide graphics in [[real time (media)|real time]] at ultra-high-resolution modes like [[Ultra HD]] are beginning, though beyond reach of all but the highest-end hardware.

== Image types ==

=== Two-dimensional ===
{{Main|2D computer graphics}}
{{See also|Video display controller}}
[[File:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]
[[2D computer graphics]] are the computer-based generation of [[digital image]]s&mdash;mostly from models, such as digital image, and by techniques specific to them.

2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional [[printing]] and [[drawing]] technologies such as typography. In those applications, the two-dimensional [[image]] is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred, because they give more direct control of the image than [[3D computer graphics]], whose approach is more akin to [[photography]] than to [[typography]].

==== Pixel art ====
{{See also|Pixel art}}

A large form of digital art being pixel art is created through the use of [[raster graphics]] [[software]], where images are edited on the [[pixel]] level. Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer and video games, [[graphing calculator]] games, and many [[mobile phone]] games are mostly pixel art.

==== Sprite graphics ====
{{See also|Sprite (computer graphics)}}

A [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] is a two-dimensional [[image]] or [[animation]] that is integrated into a larger scene. Initially including just graphical objects handled separately from the memory [[bitmap]] of a video display, this now includes various manners of graphical overlays.

Originally, sprites were a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared to be part of the normal bitmap on a [[Computer monitor|screen]], such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the [[data]] defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either electronic [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]ry or [[software]]. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a [[Computer hardware|hardware]] construct that employs custom [[Direct memory access|DMA]] channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.

==== Vector graphics ====
{{See also|Vector graphics}}
[[File:VectorBitmapExample.png|thumb|Example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster (bitmap) graphics.]]
[[Vector graphics]] formats are complementary to [[raster graphics]]. Raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of [[pixel]]s and is typically used for the representation of photographic images.<ref>{{cite book | title = Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art | author = Ira Greenberg | publisher = Apress | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-59059-617-X | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=WTl_7H5HUZAC&pg=PA115&dq=raster+vector+graphics+photographic&lr=&as_brr=0&ei=llOVR5LKCJL0iwGZ8-ywBw&sig=YEjfPOYSUDIf1CUbL5S5Jbzs7M8 }}</ref> Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There are times when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.

3D graphics compared to 2D graphics are graphics that use a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three-dimensional]] representation of geometric data. For the purpose of performance this is stored in the computer. This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing.

Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on similar [[algorithm]]s as 2D computer graphics do in the frame and raster graphics (like in 2D) in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.

3D computer graphics are the same as 3D models. The model is contained within the graphical data file, apart from the rendering. However, there are differences that include the 3D model is the representation of any 3D object. Until visually displayed a model is not graphic. Due to printing, 3D models are not only confined to virtual space. 3D rendering is how a model can be displayed. Also can be used in non-graphical [[computer simulation]]s and calculations.

=== Computer animation ===
{{See also|Computer animation}}

[[Computer animation]] is the art of creating moving images via the use of [[computer]]s. It is a subfield of computer graphics and [[animation]]. Increasingly it is created by means of [[3D computer graphics]], though [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster [[real-time rendering]] needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]]. It is also referred to as CGI ([[Computer-generated imagery]] or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.

Virtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's [[transformation matrix]]. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of [[keyframe]]s, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include [[procedural animation|procedural]] and [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating [[particle system|particle]] effects and [[crowd simulation]]s; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a [[hierarchy]] offers in [[skeletal animation|skeletal system]] set up).

To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer [[computer display|screen]] then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].

== Concepts and principles ==
Images are typically created by devices such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc.

Digital images include both [[vector graphics|vector]] images and [[raster graphics|raster]] images, but raster images are more commonly used.

=== Pixel ===
[[File:Pixel-example.png|thumb|right|In the enlarged portion of the image individual pixels are rendered as squares and can be easily seen.]]
In digital imaging, a [[pixel]] (or picture element<ref>{{Cite book

  -->sig=7tg-LuGdu6Njypaawi2bbkeq8pw}}</ref>) is a single point in a [[raster image]]. Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a [[sample (signal)|sample]] of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three
components such as [[RGB color model|red, green, and blue]].

=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are [[visual]] presentations on a surface, such as a computer screen. Examples are photographs, drawing, graphics designs, [[maps]], [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine text and illustration. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

=== Rendering ===
Rendering is the generation of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term "rendering" may be by analogy with an "artist's rendering" of a scene. Though the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the [[graphics pipeline]] along a rendering device, such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. A GPU is a  device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the [[rendering equation]]. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.

;3D projection
:[[3D projection]] is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane. As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread, especially in computer graphics, engineering and drafting.

;Ray tracing
:[[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is a technique for generating an [[digital image|image]] by tracing the path of [[light]] through [[pixel]]s in an [[image plane]]. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of [[photorealism]]; usually higher than that of typical [[scanline rendering]] methods, but at a greater [[computation time|computational cost]].

;Shading
[[File:Shading1.jpg|thumb|right|Example of shading.]]
:[[Shading]] refers to [[wikt:depicting|depicting]] depth in [[3D model]]s or illustrations by varying levels of [[darkness]]. It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. There are various techniques of shading including [[Hatching|cross hatching]] where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears. The term has been recently generalized to mean that [[shader]]s are applied.

;Texture mapping
:[[Texture mapping]] is a method for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphic]] or [[3D model]]. Its application to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr [[Edwin Catmull]] in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon.<ref>Blythe, David. ''[http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/notes.html Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL].'' Siggraph 1999. (see: [http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/node60.html Multitexture])</ref> [[Procedural texture]]s (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and [[bitmap|bitmap textures]] (created in an [[image editing]] application or imported from a [[digital camera]]) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as [[UV mapping]] (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for [[polygon mesh|polygon surfaces]], while [[NURBS|NURBS surfaces]] have their own intrinsic [[parameterization]] used as texture coordinates.

;Anti-aliasing
:Rendering resolution-independent entities (such as 3D models) for viewing on a raster (pixel-based) device such as a [[liquid-crystal display]] or [[Cathode ray tube|CRT television]] inevitably causes [[aliasing|aliasing artifacts]] mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details; these artifacts are informally called "[[jaggies]]". Anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems, resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer, but can be somewhat computationally expensive. Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such as [[supersampling]]) are able to be employed, then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery; a graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are to be used. A pre-anti-aliased [[bitmap|bitmap texture]] being displayed on a screen (or screen location) at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself (such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera) will exhibit aliasing artifacts, while any [[Procedural texture|procedurally defined texture]] will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution-independent; techniques such as [[mipmapping]] and [[texture filtering]] help to solve texture-related aliasing problems.

=== Volume rendering ===
[[File:CTWristImage.png|thumb|Volume rendered [[Computed tomography|CT]] scan of a forearm with different colour schemes for muscle, fat, bone, and blood.]]
[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a [[3D projection|2D projection]] of a 3D discretely [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] [[data set]]. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanner.

Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.

=== 3D modeling ===
[[3D modeling]] is the process of developing a mathematical, [[wire frame model|wireframe]] representation of any three-dimensional object, called a "3D model", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to [[plastic arts]] such as [[sculpting]]. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] curves to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal mesh modeling]] (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh [[Subdivision surface|subdivision]] (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURBS models). A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called ''[[3D rendering]]'', used in a [[computer]] [[simulation]] of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using [[3D Printing]] devices.

== Study of computer graphics ==
{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}
The [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]] is a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Although the term often refers to three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and [[image processing]].

As an [[academic]] discipline, computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques. It focuses on the ''mathematical'' and ''computational'' foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely [[aesthetic]] issues. Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]], although the two fields have many similarities.
