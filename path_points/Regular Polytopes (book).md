'''''Regular Polytopes''''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[geometry]] book written by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[mathematician]] [[H.S.M. Coxeter]]. Originally written in 1947, the book was updated and republished in 1963 and 1973.

The book is a comprehensive survey of the geometry of [[regular polytope]]s, the generalisation of regular [[polygon]]s and regular [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] to higher dimensions. Originating with an essay entitled ''Dimensional Analogy'' written in 1923, the first edition of the book took Coxeter 24 years to complete.

==Scope==
Coxeter starts by introducing two-dimensional polygons and three-dimensional polyhedra. He then gives a rigorous combinatorial definition of "regularity" and uses it to show that there are no other [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] regular polyhedra apart from the five [[Platonic solid]]s. The concept of "regularity" is extended to non-convex shapes such as [[star polygon]]s and [[star polyhedron|star polyhedra]]; to [[tessellation]]s and [[honeycomb]]s and to polytopes in higher dimensions. Coxeter introduces and uses the groups generated by reflections that became known as [[Coxeter group]]s.

The book combines algebraic rigour with clear explanations, many of which are illustrated with diagrams, and with a diagramatic notation for [[Wythoff construction]]s. The black and white plates in the book show solid models of three-dimensional polyhedra, and wire-frame models of projections of some higher-dimensional polytopes. At the end of each chapter Coxeter includes an "Historical remarks" section which provides an historical perspective of the development of the subject.

The challenge of comprehending higher dimensions was addressed by Coxeter on page 118:
:There are three ways of approaching the Euclidean geometry of four or more dimensions: the axiomatic, the algebraic (or analytical) and the intuitive. The first two have been admirably expounded by [[Duncan Sommerville|Sommerville]] and [[Eric Harold Neville|Neville]], and we shall presuppose some familiarity with such treatises.<ref>[[Duncan Sommerville]] (1929) ''Introduction to the Geometry of N Dimensions'' and [[Eric Harold Neville]] (1921) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/ABR2619.0001.001?rgn=works;view=toc;rgn1=author;q1=Neville The Fourth Dimension] from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection</ref> Concerning the third, [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] wrote, "A man who really pursues it, will end up holding on to the fourth dimension".

==Importance==

''Regular Polytopes'' is a standard reference work on regular polygons, polyhedra and their higher dimensional analogues. It is unusual in the breadth of its coverage; its combination of mathematical rigour with geometric insight; and the clarity of its diagrams and illustrations.

In a brief review of the 1963 Dover reprint in Math Science Network ({{MR|0151873}}) an anonymous reviewer writes that “anyone interested in the relationship of group theory to geometry should own a copy.” The original 1948 edition received a more complete review by M. Goldberg in {{MR|0027148}}, and the third edition was reviewed telegraphically in {{MR|0370327}}.
