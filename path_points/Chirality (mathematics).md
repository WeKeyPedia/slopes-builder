[[File:2 parallel footprints.JPG|thumb|Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]
In [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.

== Examples==

|}
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. A right shoe is different from a left shoe only for being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral<!--sic!--> if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as <math>v\mapsto Av+b</math> with an [[orthogonal matrix]] <math>A</math> and a vector <math>b</math>. The [[determinant]] of <math>A</math> is either 1 or &minus;1 then. If it is &minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)

==Chirality in three dimensions==
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.1.svg|thumb|Pair of chiral [[dice]] (enantiomorphs)]]
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[mirror plane of symmetry]] ''S<sub>1</sub>'', an inversion center of symmetry ''S<sub>2</sub>'', or a higher [[improper rotation]] (rotoreflection) ''S<sub>n</sub>'' axis of symmetry <ref>http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Symmetry_operations_and_symmetry_elements</ref> is achiral. (A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure <math>F</math> is a plane <math>P</math>, such that <math>F</math> is invariant under the mapping <math>(x,y,z)\mapsto(x,y,-z)</math>, when <math>P</math> is chosen to be the <math>x</math>-<math>y</math>-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure <math>F</math> is a point <math>C</math>, such that <math>F</math> is invariant under the mapping <math>(x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)</math>, when <math>C</math> is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:<math>F_0=\left\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\right\}</math>

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry <math>(x,y,z)\mapsto(-y,x,-z)</math> and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:<math>F_1=\left\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\right\}</math>

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Note also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].

==Chirality in two dimensions==
[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|bracelet]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''. The left and right images contain a horizontal reflection line.]]
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure <math>F</math> is a line <math>L</math>, such that <math>F</math> is invariant under the mapping <math>(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)</math>, when <math>L</math> is chosen to be the <math>x</math>-axis of the coordinate system.) Consider the following pattern:
:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:
:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].

==Knot theory==<!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] -->

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]]. For example the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.
