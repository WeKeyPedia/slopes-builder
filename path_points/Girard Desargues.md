'''Girard Desargues''' ({{IPA-fr|dezaʁɡ|lang}}; February 21, 1591&ndash;September 1661) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and engineer, who is considered one of the founders of [[projective geometry]].<ref>Swinden, B.A. "Geometry and Girard Desargues". The Mathematical Gazette. Vol. 34, No. 310 (Dec., 1950) p. 253</ref> [[Desargues' theorem]], the [[Desargues graph]], and the crater [[Desargues (crater)|Desargues]] on the [[Moon]] are named in his honour.

Born in [[Lyon]], Desargues came from a family devoted to service to the French crown. His father was a royal [[civil law notary|notary]], an investigating commissioner of the [[Seneschal|Seneschal's]] court in Lyon (1574), the collector of the [[tithe]]s on ecclesiastical revenues for the city of Lyon (1583) and for the [[diocese of Lyon]].

Girard Desargues worked as an [[architecture|architect]] from 1645. Prior to that, he had worked as a tutor and may have served as an engineer and technical consultant in the entourage of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]].

As an architect, Desargues planned several private and public buildings in Paris and Lyon. As an engineer, he designed a system for raising water that he installed near Paris. It was based on the use of the at the time unrecognized principle of the [[epicycloid]]al wheel.

His research on perspective and geometrical projections can be seen as a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry across the classical epoch in optics that stretched from al-Hasan [[Ibn al-Haytham]] ([[Alhazen]]) to Johannes [[Kepler]], and going beyond a mere synthesis of these traditions with Renaissance perspective theories and practices. 

His work was rediscovered and republished in 1864. A collection of his works was published in 1951,<ref>{{cite book|last=Desargues|first=Girard|title=L'oeuvre mathématique de G. Desargues: Textes publiés et commentés avec une introd. biograph. et historique|year=1951|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|location=Paris|editor-last=Taton|editor-first=René}}</ref> and the 1864 compilation remains in print.<ref>{{cite book|last=Desargues|first=Girard|title=Oeuvres de Desargues|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108032583|editor-last=Poudra|editor-first=Noël Germinal}}</ref> One notable work, often cited by others in mathematics, is "Rough draft for an essay on the results of taking plane sections of a cone" (1639). 

Late in his life, Desargues published a paper with the cryptic title of ''DALG''. The most common theory about what this stands for is ''Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre'' (proposed by [[Henri Brocard]]).

He died in Lyon.
