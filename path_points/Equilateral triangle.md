In [[geometry]], an '''equilateral triangle''' is a [[triangle]] in which all three sides are equal. In traditional or [[Euclidean geometry]], equilateral triangles are also [[Equiangular polygon|equiangular]]; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60°. They are [[regular polygon]]s, and can therefore also be referred to as regular triangles.

==Principal properties==
[[File:Equilateral-triangle-heights.svg|300px|thumb|An equilateral triangle. It has equal sides (''a''=''b''=''c''), equal angles (<math>\alpha = \beta =\gamma</math>), and equal altitudes (''h''<sub>''a''</sub>=''h''<sub>''b''</sub>=''h''<sub>''c''</sub>).]]
<!--Please do not change the formulas they are correct; check your work if you do-->
Denoting the common length of the sides of the equilateral triangle as ''a'', we can determine using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] that: 
* The area is <math>A=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2</math>
* The perimeter is <math>p=3a\,\!</math>
* The radius of the [[circumscribed circle]] is <math>R=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} a</math>
* The radius of the [[inscribed circle]] is <math>r=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} a</math> or <math> r=\frac{R}{2}</math>
* The geometric center of the triangle is the center of the circumscribed and inscribed circles
* And the [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]] (height) from any side is <math>h=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a</math>.
<br />
Many of these quantities have simple relationships to the altitude ("h") of each vertex from the opposite side:
* The area is   <math>A=\frac{h^2}{\sqrt{3}}</math>
* The height of the center from each side is   <math>\frac{h}{3} </math>
* The radius of the circle circumscribing the three vertices is  <math>R=\frac{2h}{3} </math>
* The radius of the inscribed circle is  <math>r=\frac{h}{3}</math>
<br />
In an equilateral triangle, the altitudes, the angle bisectors, the perpendicular bisectors and the medians to each side coincide.

==Characterizations==
A triangle ''ABC'' that has the sides ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', [[semiperimeter]] ''s'', [[area]] ''T'', [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Relation to area of the triangle|exradii]] ''r<sub>a</sub>'', ''r<sub>b</sub>'', ''r<sub>c</sub>'' (tangent to ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' respectively), and where ''R'' and ''r'' are the radii of the [[Circumscribed circle#Circumscribed circles of triangles|circumcircle]] and [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]] respectively, is equilateral [[if and only if]] any one of the statements in the following nine categories is true. Thus these are properties that are unique to equilateral triangles.

===Equal cevians===
Three kinds of [[cevian]]s are equal for (and only for) equilateral triangles:<ref>Byer, Owen; Lazebnik, Felix and Smeltzer, Deirdre, ''Methods for Euclidean Geometry'', Mathematical Association of America, 2010, pp. 36, 39.</ref>
*The three [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]]s have equal lengths.
*The three [[median (geometry)|median]]s have equal lengths.
*The three [[Bisection#Angle bisector|angle bisector]]s have equal lengths.

===Coincident triangle centers===
Every [[triangle center]] of an equilateral triangle coincides with its [[centroid]], and for some pairs of triangle centers, the fact that they coincide is enough to ensure that the triangle is equilateral. In particular:

*A triangle is equilateral if any two of the [[Circumscribed circle|circumcenter]], [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incenter]], centroid, or [[Altitude (triangle)|orthocenter]] coincide.<ref>Yiu, Paul, ''Notes on Euclidean Geometry'', 1998, p. 37, [http://www.math.fau.edu/Yiu/EuclideanGeomeryNotes.pdf]</ref> 

*It is also equilateral if its circumcenter coincides with the [[Nagel point]], or if its incenter coincides with its [[Nine-point circle#Other interesting facts|nine-point center]].<ref name=Andreescu>Andreescu, Titu and Andrica, Dorian, "Complex Numbers from A to...Z", Birkhäuser, 2006, pp. 70, 113-115.</ref>

===Six triangles formed by partitioning by the medians===

For any triangle, the three [[median (geometry)|medians]] partition the triangle into six smaller triangles.

*A triangle is equilateral if and only if any three of the smaller triangles have either the same perimeter or the same inradius.<ref name=Cerin>[http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2004volume4/FG200413.pdf Cˇerin, Zvonko, "The vertex-midpoint-centroid triangles", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 4, 2004: pp. 97–109.]</ref>{{rp|Theorem 1}}

*A triangle is equilateral if and only if the circumcenters of any three of the smaller triangles have the same distance from the centroid.<ref name=Cerin/>{{rp|Corollary 7}}

===Points in the plane===

* A triangle is equilateral if and only if, for ''every'' point ''P'' in the plane, with distances ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' to the triangle's sides and distances ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' to its vertices,<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.178,#235.4}}

::<math>4(p^2+q^2+r^2) \geq x^2+y^2+z^2.</math>

==Notable theorems==
[[Morley's trisector theorem]] states that, in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent [[Angle trisection|angle trisectors]] form an equilateral triangle.

[[Napoleon's theorem]] states that, if equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of any triangle, either all outward, or all inward, the centers of those equilateral triangles themselves form an equilateral triangle.

A version of the [[isoperimetric inequality]] for triangles states that the triangle of greatest [[area]] among all those with a given [[perimeter]] is equilateral.<ref name=Chakerian/>

[[Viviani's theorem]] states that, for any interior point ''P'' in an equilateral triangle, with distances ''d'', ''e'', and ''f'' from the sides, ''d'' + ''e'' + ''f'' = the altitude of the triangle, independent of the location of ''P''.<ref name=Posamentier>Posamentier, Alfred S., and Salkind, Charles T., ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover Publ., 1996.</ref>

[[Pompeiu's theorem]] states that, if ''P'' is an arbitrary point in an equilateral triangle ''ABC'', then there exists a triangle with sides of length ''PA'', ''PB'', and ''PC''.

==Other properties==
By [[Euler's theorem in geometry|Euler's inequality]], the equilateral triangle has the smallest ratio ''R''/''r'' of the circumradius to the inradius of any triangle: specifically, ''R''/''r'' = 2.<ref>Dragutin Svrtan and Darko Veljan, "Non-Euclidean versions of some classical triangle inequalities", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 12 (2012),  197–209.  http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2012volume12/FG201217index.html </ref>{{rp|p. 198}}

The ratio of the area of the incircle to the area of an equilateral triangle, <math>\frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}</math>, is larger than that of any non-equilateral triangle.<ref>Minda, D., and Phelps, S., "Triangles, ellipses, and cubic polynomials", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' 115, October 2008, 679-689: Theorem 4.1.</ref>

:<math>\frac{7}{9} \leq \frac{A_1}{A_2} \leq \frac{9}{7}.</math>

Given a point ''P'' in the interior of an equilateral triangle, the ratio of the sum of its distances from the vertices to the sum of its distances from the sides equals 2 and is less than that of any other triangle.<ref>[http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2001volume1/FG200102.pdf  Lee, Hojoo, "Another proof of the Erdős–Mordell Theorem", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 1, 2001: 7-8.]</ref> This is the [[Erdős–Mordell inequality]]; a stronger variant of it is [[Barrow's inequality]], which replaces the perpendicular distances to the sides with the distances from ''P'' to the points where the [[angle bisector]]s of  ∠''APB'', ∠''BPC'', and ∠''CPA'' cross the sides (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' being the vertices).

For any point P in the plane, with distances ''p'', ''q'', and ''t'' from the vertices A, B, and C respectively,<ref name="De">De, Prithwijit, "Curious properties of the circumcircle and incircle of an equilateral triangle," ''Mathematical Spectrum'' 41(1), 2008-2009, 32-35.</ref>

and

moreover, if point D on side BC divides PA into segments PD and DA with DA having length ''z'' and PD having length ''y'', then<ref name=Posamentier/>{{rp|172}}
:<math>z= \frac{t^{2}+tq+q^2}{t+q},</math>

which also equals <math>\tfrac{t^{3}-q^{3}}{t^{2}-q^{2}}</math> if ''t'' ≠ ''q''; and
:<math>\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{t}=\frac{1}{y},</math>

which is the [[optic equation]].

An equilateral triangle is the most symmetrical triangle, having 3 lines of [[reflection symmetry|reflection]] and [[rotational symmetry]] of order 3 about its center. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[dihedral group of order 6]] ''D''<sub>3</sub>.

Equilateral triangles are the only triangles whose [[Steiner inellipse]] is a circle (specifically, it is the incircle).

[[Image:Viervlak-frame.jpg|thumb|right|A regular tetrahedron is made of four equilateral triangles.]]
Equilateral triangles are found in many other geometric constructs. The intersection of circles whose centers are a radius width apart is a pair of equilateral arches, each of which can be inscribed with an equilateral triangle. They form faces of regular and uniform [[polyhedra]]. Three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s are composed of equilateral triangles. In particular, the [[Tetrahedron|regular tetrahedron]] has four equilateral triangles for faces and can be considered the three-dimensional analogue of the shape. The plane can be [[Tiling by regular polygons|tiled]] using equilateral triangles giving the [[triangular tiling]].

==Geometric construction==
[[Image:Equilateral triangle construction.svg|200px|thumb|right|Construction of equilateral triangle with compass and straightedge]]
An equilateral triangle is easily constructed using a [[compass and straightedge]]. Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment. Repeat with the other side of the line. Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment

Alternate method:

Draw a circle with radius ''r'', place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.

The proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of [[Euclid's Elements]].

==Derivation of area formula==

The area formula <math>A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2</math> in terms of side length ''a'' can be derived directly using the Pythagorean theorem or using trionometry.

===Using the Pythagorean theorem===
The area of a triangle is half of one side ''a'' times the height ''h'' from that side:

:<math>A = \frac{1}{2} ah.</math>

[[Image:30-60-90.svg|thumb|150px|An equilateral triangle with a side of 2 has a height of {{sqrt|3}} and the sine of 60° is {{sqrt|3}}/2.]]
The legs of either right triangle formed by an altitude of the equilateral triangle are half of the base ''a'', and the hypotenuse is the side ''a'' of the equilateral triangle. The height of an equilateral triangle can be found using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]

:<math>\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + h^2 = a^2</math>

so that

:<math>h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a.</math>

Substituting ''h'' into the area formula (1/2)''ah'' gives the area formula for the equilateral triangle:

:<math>A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2.</math>

===Using trigonometry===
Using trigonometry, the area of a triangle with any two sides ''a'' and ''b'', and an angle ''C'' between them is

:<math>A = \frac{1}{2} ab \sin C.</math>

Each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60°, so

:<math>A = \frac{1}{2} ab \sin 60^\circ.</math>

The sine of 60° is <math>\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</math>. Thus

:<math>A = \frac{1}{2} ab \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}ab = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2</math>

since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.

==In culture and society==
Equilateral triangles have frequently appeared in man made constructions:
*Some [[archaeological site]]s have equilateral triangles as part of their construction, for example [[Lepenski Vir]] in Serbia.
*The shape also occurs in modern architecture such as [[Randhurst Mall]] and the [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]].
*The [[Flag of the Philippines]], the [[Seal of the President of the Philippines]] and the [[Flag of Junqueirópolis]] contain equilateral triangles.
*It is a shape of a variety of [[Traffic sign|road signs]], including the [[Yield sign]].
*[[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] a [[NIC]] [[Fraternity]] uses the equilateral triangle as its primary symbol.
