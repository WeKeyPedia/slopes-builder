|[[File:Uniform polyhedron-53-t012.png|200px]]<BR>The [[truncated icosidodecahedron]], with 120 vertices, is the largest Archimedean solid.

In [[geometry]], an '''Archimedean solid''' is a highly symmetric, semi-regular [[convex polyhedron]] composed of two or more types of [[regular polygon]]s meeting in identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]. They are distinct from the [[Platonic solid]]s, which are composed of only one type of polygon meeting in identical vertices, and from the [[Johnson solid]]s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.

"Identical vertices" are usually taken to mean that for any two vertices, there must be an [[isometry]] of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other. Sometimes it is instead only required that the faces that meet at one vertex are related isometrically to the faces that meet at the other. This difference in definitions controls whether the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron) is considered an Archimedean solid or a [[Johnson solid]]: it is the unique convex polyhedron that has regular polygons meeting in the same way at each vertex, but that does not have a global symmetry taking every vertex to every other vertex. Based on its existence, {{harvs|first=Branko|last=Grünbaum|authorlink=Branko Grünbaum|year=2009|txt}} has suggested a terminological distinction in which an Archimedean solid is defined as having the same vertex figure at each vertex (including the elongated square gyrobicupola) while a [[uniform polyhedron]] is defined as having each vertex symmetric to each other vertex (excluding the [[gyrobicupola]]).

[[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s, whose [[symmetry group]]s are the [[dihedral group]]s, are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, despite meeting the above definition. With this restriction, there are only finitely many Archimedean solids. All but the elongated square gyrobicupola can be made via [[Wythoff construction]]s from the Platonic solids with [[Tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] and [[icosahedral symmetry]].

==Origin of name==
The Archimedean solids take their name from [[Archimedes]], who discussed them in a now-lost work. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] refers to it, stating that Archimedes listed 13 polyhedra.<ref name="g09">{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2009}}.</ref> During the [[Renaissance]], [[artist]]s and [[mathematician]]s valued ''pure forms'' and rediscovered all of these forms. This search was almost entirely completed around 1620 by [[Johannes Kepler]],<ref>Field J., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler,	''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', '''50''', 1997, 227</ref> who defined [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], [[antiprisms]], and the non-convex solids known as the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

Kepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola (pseudorhombicuboctahedron): at least, he once stated that there were 14 Archimedean solids. However, his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra, and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedron's existence was made in 1905, by [[Duncan Sommerville]].<ref name="g09"/>

==Classification==
There are 13 Archimedean solids (not counting the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]]; 15 if the [[mirror image]]s of two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]], see below, are counted separately).

Here the ''vertex configuration'' refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a [[vertex configuration]] of (4,6,8) means that a [[square]], [[hexagon]], and [[octagon]] meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex).

Some definitions of [[semiregular polyhedron]] include one more figure, the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] or "pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron".<ref>{{harvtxt|Malkevitch|1988}}, p.&nbsp;85</ref>

== Properties ==

The number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex [[Defect (geometry)|angle defect]].

The cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are [[edge-uniform]] and are called [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasi-regular]].

The [[dual polyhedron|duals]] of the Archimedean solids are called the [[Catalan solid]]s.  Together with the [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]], these are the [[face-uniform]] solids with regular vertices.

=== Chirality ===

The snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as ''[[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'', as they come in a left-handed (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) form and right-handed (Latin: dextromorph) form. When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional [[mirror image]], these forms may be called enantiomorphs.  (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain [[chemical compound]]s).

== Construction of Archimedean solids ==
{{Further|Uniform polyhedron|Conway polyhedron notation}}
[[File:Polyhedron truncation example3.png|thumb|The Archimedeans solids can be constructed as generator positions in a kaleidoscope.]]
The different Archimedean and Platonic solids can be related to each other using just several general constructions.  Starting with a Platonic solid, [[truncation (geometry)|truncation]] involves cutting away of corners.  To preserve symmetry, the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners.  Depending on how much is truncated (see table below), different Platonic and Archimedean (and other) solids can be created. [[expansion (geometry)|Expansion]] or [[cantellation]] involves moving each face away from the center (by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the Platonic solid) and taking the convex hull.  Expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces, thus breaking the rectangles corresponding to edges into triangles.  The last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges.  Ignoring scaling, expansion can also be viewed as truncation of corners and edges but with a particular ratio between corner and edge truncation.

Note the duality between the cube and the octahedron, and between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.  Also, in part due to self-duality of the tetrahedron, only one Archimedean solid has only tetrahedral symmetry.
