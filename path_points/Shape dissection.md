In geometry, a '''dissection problem ''' is the problem of partitioning a geometric [[shape|figure]] (such as a [[polytope]] or [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]) into smaller pieces that may be rearranged into a new figure of equal content. In this context, the partitioning is called simply a '''dissection''' (of one polytope into another). It is usually required that the dissection use only a finite number of pieces. 

The [[Bolyai-Gerwien theorem]] states that any [[polygon]] may be dissected into any other polygon of the same area.  It is not true, however, that any [[polyhedron]] has a dissection into any other polyhedron of the same volume. This process ''is'' possible, however, for any two [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]] (such as [[cube]]) in three dimension and any two [[zonohedra]] of equal volume (in any dimension).

A dissection into [[triangle]]s of equal area is called an [[equidissection]]. Most polygons cannot be equidissected, and those that can often have restrictions on the possible numbers of triangles. For example, [[Monsky's theorem]] states that there is no odd equidissection of a [[square]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Stein |first=Sherman K. |date=March 2004 |title=Cutting a Polygon into Triangles of Equal Areas |journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=17–21 |doi=10.1007/BF02985395 |zbl=1186.52015}}</ref>
