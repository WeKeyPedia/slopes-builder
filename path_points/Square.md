In [[geometry]], a '''square''' is a [[regular polygon|regular]] [[quadrilateral]], which means that it has four equal sides and four equal [[angle]]s (90-[[degree (angle)|degree]] angles, or [[right angles]]).<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Square.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Square." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]</ref> It can also be defined as a [[rectangle]] in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''ABCD'' would be denoted {{squarenotation|ABCD}}.

The square is the n=2 case of the families of n-[[hypercubes]] and n-[[orthoplex]]es.

A square has [[Schläfli symbol]] {4}. A [[truncation (geometry)|truncated]] square, t{4} is an [[octagon]], {8}. An [[Alternation (geometry)|alternated]] square, h{4} is a [[digon]], {2}.

==Characterizations==
[[File:Symmetries of square.svg|thumb|The square has dihedral point symmetry, Dih<sub>4</sub>, or [[orbifold notation|orbifold]] (*44), with reflective subsymmetries: *22, *, and rotational subsymmetries: 44, 22, 1. These subsymmetries can be seen in 7 lower symmetry quadrilaterals, depending on whether the mirror lines are on the vertices or edges. The gyration square has the full geometry of the square, but has edge markings that define a rotating orientation of edges.<ref>[[John Horton Conway|John H. Conway]], Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strass, ''The Symmetries of Things'' 2008, ISBN 978-1-56881-220-5 (p.272, figure 20.3)</ref>]]
A [[Convex and concave polygons|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] is a square [[if and only if]] it is any one of the following:<ref>Zalman Usiskin and Jennifer Griffin, "The Classification of Quadrilaterals.

* a [[quadrilateral]] with four equal sides and four [[right angle]]s
* a [[parallelogram]] with one right angle and two adjacent equal sides

==Perimeter and area==
[[Image:Five Squared.svg|150px|right|thumb|The area of a square is the product of the length of its sides.]]
The [[perimeter]] of a square whose four sides have length <math>\ell </math> is
:<math>P=4\ell </math>

and the [[area]] ''A'' is
:<math>A=\ell^2.</math>

In classical times, the second power was described in terms of the area of a square, as in the above formula. This led to the use of the term ''[[Square (algebra)|square]]'' to mean raising to the second power.

The area can also be calculated using the diagonal ''d'' according to
:<math>A=\frac{d^2}{2}.</math> 

In terms of the circumradius ''R'', the area of a square is
:<math>A=2R^2</math>

and in terms of the inradius ''r'', its area is
:<math>A=4r^2.</math>

A convex quadrilateral with successive sides ''a, b, c, d'' is a square if and only if

''Forum Geometricorum'', 14 (2014), 129-144.  [http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2014volume14/FG201412index.html] </ref>{{rp|Corollary 15}}

:<math>A= \frac{1}{2}(a^2+c^2)=\frac{1}{2}(b^2+d^2).</math>

==Coordinates and equations==
[[File:Square equation plot.svg|thumb|right|<math>|x| + |y| = 2</math> plotted on ''[[Cartesian coordinates]]''.]]
The coordinates for the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a square with vertical and horizontal sides, centered at the origin and with side length 2 are (±1,&nbsp;±1), while the interior of this square consists of all points (''x''<sub>i</sub>, ''y''<sub>i</sub>) with {{nowrap|−1 < ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> < 1}} and {{nowrap|−1 < ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> < 1}}. The equation
:<math>\max(x^2, y^2) = 1</math>

specifies the boundary of this square. This equation means "''x''<sup>2</sup> or ''y''<sup>2</sup>, whichever is larger, equals 1." The [[circumradius]] of this square (the radius of a circle drawn through the square's vertices) is half the square's diagonal, and equals <math>\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}</math>. Then the [[circumcircle]] has the equation
:<math>x^2 + y^2 = 2.</math>

Alternatively the equation

:<math>\left|x - a\right| + \left|y - b\right| = r.</math>

can also be used to describe the boundary of a square with center [[Coordinate system|coordinates]]  (''a'', ''b'') and a horizontal or vertical radius of ''r''.

==Construction==
[[File:Straight Square Inscribed in a Circle 240px.gif|thumb|right|Construction of a square using a compass and straightedge.]]
The animation at the right shows how to construct a square using a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].

==Properties==
A square is a special case of a [[rhombus]] (equal sides, opposite equal angles), a [[Kite (geometry)|kite]] (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), a [[parallelogram]] (opposite sides parallel), a [[quadrilateral]] or [[tetragon]] (four-sided polygon), and a [[rectangle]] (opposite sides equal, right-angles) and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely:<ref name= "MathsIsFun">http://www.mathsisfun.com/quadrilaterals.html/</ref>
*The [[diagonal]]s of a square [[bisection|bisect]] each other and meet at 90°
*The diagonals of a square bisect its angles.
*Opposite sides of a square are both [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] and equal in length.
*All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is 360°/4 = 90°, so every angle of a square is a right angle.)
*All four sides of a square are equal.
*The diagonals of a square are equal.

==Other facts==
*The diagonals of a square are <math>\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}</math> (about 1.414) times the length of a side of the square. This value, known as the [[square root of 2]] or Pythagoras' constant, was the first number proven to be [[irrational number|irrational]].
*A square can also be defined as a [[parallelogram]] with equal diagonals that bisect the angles.
*If a figure is both a rectangle (right angles) and a rhombus (equal edge lengths), then it is a square.
*If a circle is circumscribed around a square, the area of the circle is <math>\pi/2</math> (about 1.5708) times the area of the square.
*If a circle is inscribed in the square, the area of the circle is <math>\pi/4</math> (about 0.7854) times the area of the square.
*A square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter.<ref>http://www2.mat.dtu.dk/people/V.L.Hansen/square.html</ref>
*A [[square tiling]] is one of three [[Tiling by regular polygons|regular tilings]] of the plane (the others are the [[equilateral triangle]] and the [[regular hexagon]]).
*The square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions: [[hypercube]] and the [[cross polytope]]. The [[Schläfli symbol]] for the square is&nbsp;{4}.
*The square is a highly symmetric object. There are four lines of [[Reflection symmetry|reflectional symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] of order 4 (through 90°, 180° and 270°). Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[dihedral group]]&nbsp;D<sub>4</sub>.
*If the inscribed circle of a square ''ABCD'' has tangency points ''E'' on ''AB'', ''F'' on ''BC'', ''G'' on ''CD'', and ''H'' on ''DA'', then for any point ''P'' on the inscribed circle,<ref>http://gogeometry.com/problem/p331_square_inscribed_circle.htm</ref>
::<math> 2(PH^2-PE^2) = PD^2-PB^2.</math>

==Squares inscribed in triangles==
{{Main|Triangle#Squares}}

Every [[acute triangle]] has three [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] squares (squares in its interior such that all four of a square's vertices lie on a side of the triangle, so two of them lie on the same side and hence one side of the square coincides with part of a side of the triangle). In a [[right triangle]] two of the squares coincide and have a vertex at the triangle's right angle, so a right triangle has only two ''distinct'' inscribed squares. An [[obtuse triangle]] has only one inscribed square, with a side coinciding with part of the triangle's longest side.

The fraction of the triangle's area that is filled by the square is no more than 1/2.

==Squaring the circle==

[[Squaring the circle]] is the problem, proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]], of constructing a square with the same area as a given [[circle]] by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]]. 

In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]] which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[transcendental number]], rather than an [[algebraic number|algebraic irrational number]]; that is, it is not the [[root of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.

==Non-Euclidean geometry==
In non-Euclidean geometry, squares are more generally polygons with 4 equal sides and equal angles.

In [[spherical geometry]], a square is a polygon whose edges are [[great circle]] arcs of equal distance, which meet at equal angles. Unlike the square of plane geometry, the angles of such a square are larger than a right angle. Larger spherical squares have larger angles.

In [[hyperbolic geometry]], squares with right angles do not exist. Rather, squares in hyperbolic geometry have angles of less than right angles. Larger hyperbolic squares have smaller angles.

'''Examples:'''
{| class="wikitable" width=850
|[[Image:Tetragonal dihedron.png|200px]]<br>Two squares can tile the sphere with 2 squares around each vertex and 180-degree [[internal angle]]s. Each square covers an entire hemisphere and their vertices lie along a [[great circle]]. This is called a spherical square [[dihedron]]. The [[Schläfli symbol]] is&nbsp;{4,2}. 
|[[Image:Square on sphere.svg|200px]]<br>Six squares can tile the sphere with 3 squares around each vertex and 120-degree [[internal angle]]s. This is called a spherical cube. The [[Schläfli symbol]] is&nbsp;{4,3}.
|[[Image:Square on plane.svg|200px]]<br>[[Square tiling|Squares can tile]] the [[Euclidean plane]] with 4 around each vertex, with each square having an internal angle of 90°. The [[Schläfli symbol]] is [[Square tiling|{4,4}]].
|[[Image:Square on hyperbolic plane.png|200px]]<br>[[Order-5 square tiling|Squares can tile]] the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] with 5 around each vertex, with each square having 72-degree internal angles. The [[Schläfli symbol]] is&nbsp;[[Order-5 square tiling|{4,5}]]. In fact,  for any n ≥ 5 there is a hyperbolic tiling with n squares about each vertex.

==Graphs==
[[File:Tetrahedron petrie.png|150px|right|thumb|[[3-simplex]] (3D)]]
The K<sub>4</sub> [[complete graph]] is often drawn as a square with all 6 edges connected. This graph also represents an [[orthographic projection]] of the 4 vertices and 6 edges of the regular 3-[[simplex]] ([[tetrahedron]]).
