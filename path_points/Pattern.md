[[File:Igreja de Campanha Azulejo 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tile|Tilings]], such as these from [[:pt:Igreja de Campanhã|Igreja de Campanhã]], Porto, [[Portugal]], are visual patterns used for decoration.]]

A '''pattern''', apart from the term's use to mean "[[wikt:template|Template]]",{{efn|From the [[French language|French]] ''patron'' ('template')}} is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A '''geometric pattern''' is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeating like a [[wallpaper]].

Any of the five senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in [[science]], mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual [[patterns in nature]] are often [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], never exactly repeating, and often involve [[fractals]]. Natural patterns include [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]], and those created by [[Symmetry|symmetries]] of [[rotation symmetry|rotation]] and [[reflection symmetry|reflection]]. Patterns have an underlying [[Mathematics|mathematical]] structure;<ref>Stewart, 2001. Page 6.</ref> indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.

In art and architecture, decorations or [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]] may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a [[software design pattern]] is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]] used to create any number of similar garments.

== Nature ==
{{main|Patterns in nature}}

Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including [[symmetry|symmetries]], trees and other structures with a [[fractal]] dimension, [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.<ref>Stevens, Peter. ''Patterns in Nature'', 1974. Page 3.</ref>

=== Symmetry ===

[[File:Schnee1.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Snowflake]] [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]]]

Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]] as this favours movement.<ref>Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 48-49.</ref> Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers, as well as animals which are largely static as adults, such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], including [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].<ref>Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 64-65.</ref>

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms.<ref>Stewart, Ian. 2001. Page 52.</ref> [[Crystal]]s have a highly specific set of possible [[crystal habit|crystal symmetries]]; they can be cubic or octahedral, but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).<ref>Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 82-84.</ref>

=== Spirals ===

[[File:Aloe polyphylla spiral.jpg|thumb|75px|''[[Aloe polyphylla]]'' [[phyllotaxis]]]]

Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including [[molluscs]] such as the [[nautilus]], and in the [[phyllotaxis]] of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the [[sunflower]] and fruit structures like the [[pineapple]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | year=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}</ref>

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===
[[File:Vortex-street-1-90deg.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Vortex street]] turbulence]]

[[Chaos theory]] predicts that while the laws of [[physics]] are [[deterministic]], events and patterns in nature never exactly repeat because extremely small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Chaos | author=Crutchfield, James P; Farmer, J Doyne,; Packard, Norman H; Shaw, Robert S | journal=Scientific American |date=December 1986 | volume=254 | issue=12 | pages=46–57}}</ref> Many natural patterns are shaped by this apparent randomness, including [[vortex street]]s<ref>von Kármán, Theodore.

=== Waves, dunes ===
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Dune]] [[Capillary wave|ripple]]]]

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.<ref>French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.</ref> [[Wind wave]]s are [[surface wave]]s that create the chaotic patterns of the sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of [[dune]]s.<ref>{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | year=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}</ref>

=== Bubbles, foam ===

[[File:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Foam]] of [[soap bubble]]s]]

[[Foam]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]]. Foam and bubble patterns occur widely in nature, for example in [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, and the skeletons of [[silicoflagellate]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.<ref>Philip Ball. ''Shapes'', 2009. pp 68, 96-101.</ref><ref>[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.</ref>

=== Cracks ===
[[File:Cracked earth in the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|75px|Shrinkage [[Fracture|Cracks]]]]

[[Fracture|Crack]]s form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics.<ref>Stevens, Peter. 1974. Page 207.</ref>

Murray|James Murray]], described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns, for example in the skin of mammals or the plumage of birds: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system involving two counter-acting chemical mechanisms, one that activates and one that inhibits a development, such as of dark pigment in the skin.<ref name=Ball159>Ball, Philip. ''Shapes''. 2009. Pages 159–167.</ref> These patterns slowly drift, the animals' appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted.

=== Tilings ===
{{further|Tessellation|Tile}}

In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way "organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner." At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[tapestry]], ceramic [[Tile|tiling]] or [[carpet]], but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing "skeleton" in the artwork.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/pattern/pattern.htm | title=Art, Design, and Visual Thinking | publisher=Cornell University | work=Pattern | year=1995 | accessdate=12 December 2012 | author=Jirousek, Charlotte}}</ref> In mathematics, a [[tessellation]] is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.<ref name=Grunbaum>{{cite book|last=Grünbaum|first=Branko|title=Tilings and Patterns|year=1987|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York|author2=Shephard, G. C.}}</ref>

===In architecture===
[[Image:Hampi1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Patterns in architecture: the Virupaksha temple at Hampi has a [[fractal]]-like structure where the parts resemble the whole.]]
{{main|Pattern (architecture)}}

In architecture, [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically (see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as [[column]]s, [[pediment]]s, and [[lintel]]s.<ref>{{cite book | title=A History of Western Art | publisher=McGraw Hill | author=Adams, Laurie | year=2001 | page=99}}</ref> Repetitions need not be identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form, where elements of the pattern repeat in a [[fractal]]-like way at different sizes.<ref>{{cite book | title=Heaven's Fractal Net: Retrieving Lost Visions in the Humanities | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Jackson, William Joseph | year=2004 | page=2}}</ref>

== Science and mathematics ==
[[File:Fractal fern explained.png|thumb|upright|Fractal model of a fern illustrating [[self-similar]]ity]]

[[Mathematics]] is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2214851?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101539380483 | title=Mathematics as a Science of Patterns: Ontology and Reference | author=Resnik, Michael D. | journal=Noûs |date=November 1981 | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages=529–550 | doi=10.2307/2214851}}</ref> For example, any [[sequence]] of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coas.howard.edu/mathematics/faculty/bayne/patterns.html | title=MATH 012 Patterns in Mathematics - spring 2012 | year=2012 | accessdate=16 January 2013 | author=Bayne, Richard E}}</ref>

=== Fractals ===

Some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those that explain [[patterns in nature]] including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. [[Fractal]]s are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. Self-similarity is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their [[pattern formation|formation]] can be simple (e.g. [[Lindenmayer system]]s describing [[tree]] shapes).<ref name="Mandelbrot1983">{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |title=The fractal geometry of nature
|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC |year=1983| publisher=Macmillan
|isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}</ref>

In [[pattern theory]], devised by [[Ulf Grenander]], mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally friendly manner.<ref>{{cite book | title=Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Grenander, Ulf; Miller, Michael | year=2007}}</ref>

In the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of patterns.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/smg/Website/UCP/ | title=Causal Patterns in Science | publisher=Harvard Graduate School of Education | year=2008 | accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>

== Computer science ==

In computer science, a [[software design pattern]], in the sense of a [[Template method pattern|template]], is a general solution to a problem in programming. A design pattern provides a reusable architectural outline that may speed the development of many computer programs.<ref>Gamma et al, 1994.</ref>

== Fashion ==
{{main|Pattern (sewing)}}
In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]], a technical two-dimensional tool used to create any number of identical garments. It can be considered as a means of translating from the drawing to the real garment.<ref>Loppa, 2003.</ref>
