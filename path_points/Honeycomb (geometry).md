[[Image:cubic honeycomb.png|thumb|150px|[[cubic honeycomb]]]]
In [[geometry]], a '''honeycomb''' is a ''space filling'' or ''[[close packing]]'' of [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] or higher-dimensional ''cells'', so that there are no gaps. It is an example of the more general mathematical ''tiling'' or ''[[tessellation]]'' in any number of dimensions.

Honeycombs are usually constructed in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] ("flat") space. They may also be constructed in [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean spaces]], such as [[#Hyperbolic honeycombs|hyperbolic honeycombs]].  Any finite uniform [[polytope]] can be projected to its [[circumsphere]] to form a uniform honeycomb in spherical space.

[[Image:Wallpaper group-cmm-1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|It is possible to fill the plane with [[polygon]]s which do not meet at their corners, for example using [[rectangle]]s, as in a [[brick]] wall pattern: this is not a proper tiling because corners lie part way along the edge of a neighbouring polygon. Similarly, in a proper honeycomb, there must be no edges or vertices lying part way along the face of a neighbouring cell. Note that if we interpret each brick face as a [[hexagon]] having two interior angles of 180 degrees, we can now accept the pattern as a proper tiling. However, not all geometers accept such hexagons.]]

==Classification==
There are infinitely many honeycombs, which have only been partially classified. The more regular ones have attracted the most interest, while a rich and varied assortment of others continue to be discovered.

The simplest honeycombs to build are formed from stacked layers or ''slabs'' of [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] based on some [[tessellation]] of the plane. In particular, for every [[parallelepiped]], copies can fill space, with the [[cubic honeycomb]] being special because it is the only ''regular'' honeycomb in ordinary (Euclidean) space.  Another interesting family is the [[Hill tetrahedron|Hill tetrahedra]] and their generalizations, which can also tile the space.

===Uniform honeycombs===
A '''uniform honeycomb''' is a honeycomb in Euclidean 3-space composed of [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedral]] [[Cell (geometry)|cells]], and having all vertices the same (i.e., the group of [isometries of 3-space that preserve the tiling] is ''[[vertex-transitive|transitive on vertices]]''). There are 28 [[Convex polytope|convex]] examples,<ref>Gr&uuml;nbaum & Shephard, Uniform tilings of 3-space.</ref> also called the '''[[convex uniform honeycomb|Archimedean honeycombs]]'''.

A honeycomb is called '''regular''' if the group of isometries preserving the tiling acts transitively on flags, where a '''flag''' is a vertex lying on an edge lying on a face lying on a cell.  Every regular honeycomb is automatically uniform.  However, there is just one regular honeycomb in Euclidean 3-space, the [[cubic honeycomb]].   Two are ''quasiregular'' (made from two types of regular cells):

|}
The [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]] and [[gyrated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]]s are generated by 3 or 2 positions of slab layer of cells, each alternating tetrahedra and octahedra. An infinite number of unique honeycombs can be created by higher order of patterns of repeating these slab layers.

===Space-filling polyhedra<ref>{{mathworld | urlname = Space-FillingPolyhedron | title = Space-filling polyhedron}}</ref>===
A honeycomb having all cells identical within its symmetries is said to be '''[[cell-transitive]]''' or '''isochoric'''. A cell of such a honeycomb is said to be a ''space-filling polyhedron''. Known examples include:
* The regular packings<ref>[http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Figures/5.4.jpg] Uniform space-filling using triangular, square, and hexagonal prisms</ref> of [[Cubic honeycomb|cubes]], [[Hexagonal prismatic honeycomb|hexagonal prisms]], and [[Triangular prismatic honeycomb|triangular prisms]].

Sometimes, two <ref>[http://science.unitn.it/~gabbrielli/p8_gallery.html] Gabbrielli, Ruggero. A thirteen-sided polyhedron which fills space with its chiral copy.</ref> or more different polyhedra may be combined to fill space. Besides many of the uniform honeycombs, another well known example is the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]], adopted from the structure of clathrate hydrate crystals <ref>Pauling, Linus. The Nature of the Chemical Bond. Cornell University Press, 1960</ref>

===Non-convex honeycombs===
Documented examples are rare. Two classes can be distinguished:
*Non-convex cells which pack without overlapping, analogous to tilings of concave polygons. These include [[stellated rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb|a packing]] of the small [[stellated rhombic dodecahedron]], as in the [[Yoshimoto Cube]].
*Overlapping of cells whose positive and negative densities 'cancel out' to form a uniformly dense continuum, analogous to overlapping tilings of the plane.

===Hyperbolic honeycombs===

In [[hyperbolic space]], the [[dihedral angle]] of a polyhedron depends on its size.  The regular hyperbolic honeycombs thus include two with four or five [[dodecahedron|dodecahedra]] meeting at each edge; their dihedral angles thus are π/2 and 2π/5, both of which are less than that of a Euclidean dodecahedron.  Apart from this effect, the hyperbolic honeycombs obey the same topological constraints as Euclidean honeycombs and polychora.

The 4 compact [[List of regular polytopes#Tessellations of hyperbolic 3-space|regular hyperbolic honeycombs]] and many [[Convex uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space|uniform hyperbolic honeycombs]] have been enumerated.

==Duality of honeycombs==

For every honeycomb there is a dual honeycomb, which may be obtained by exchanging:
: cells for vertices.
: faces for edges.

These are just the rules for dualising four-dimensional [[4-polytope]]s, except that the usual finite method of reciprocation about a concentric hypersphere can run into problems.

The more regular honeycombs dualise neatly:
*The cubic honeycomb is self-dual.
*That of octahedra and tetrahedra is dual to that of rhombic dodecahedra.
*The slab honeycombs derived from uniform plane tilings are dual to each other in the same way that the tilings are.
*The duals of the remaining Archimedean honeycombs are all cell-transitive and have been described by Inchbald.<ref>Inchbald, G.: The Archimedean Honeycomb duals, ''The Mathematical Gazette'' '''81''', July 1997, p.p. 213–219.</ref>

=== Self-dual honeycombs ===
Honeycombs can also be [[duality (mathematics)|self-dual]]. All n-dimensional [[hypercubic honeycomb]]s with [[Schläfli symbol]]s {4,3<sup>''n''&minus;2</sup>,4},  are self-dual.
