[[Mathematics|Mathematical]] ideas have been used as inspiration for a number of [[fiber art]]s including [[quilt]] [[quilting|making]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]] and [[weaving]]. A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including [[topology]], [[graph theory]], [[number theory]] and [[algebra]]. Some techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]] are naturally [[geometry|geometrical]]; other kinds of [[textile]] provide a ready means for the colorful [[mathematics and art|physical expression of mathematical concepts]].

==Quilting==

The [[IEEE Spectrum]] has organized a number of competitions on [[quilt block]] design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject ''Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required''. Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the [[golden rectangle]], [[conic section]]s, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s Claw, the [[Koch curve]], the [[Clifford torus]], [[San Gaku]], [[Lorenzo Mascheroni|Mascheroni]]'s [[cardioid]], [[Pythagorean triple]]s, [[spidron]]s, and the six [[trigonometric functions]].<ref>{{citation

==Knitting and crochet==

Knitted mathematical objects include the [[Platonic solid]]s, [[Klein bottle]]s and [[Boy's surface]].
The [[Lorenz attractor|Lorenz manifold]] and the [[Hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic plane]] have been crafted using crochet.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Henderson | first1 = David | last2 = Taimina | first2 = Daina | author2-link = Daina Taimina | doi = 10.1007/BF03026623 | issue = 2 | journal = [[Mathematical Intelligencer]]

==Embroidery==

Embroidery techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]]<ref>Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance. ''World Textiles'', Little, Brown, 1999.</ref> including [[cross-stitch]] and some [[canvas work]] methods such as [[Bargello (needlework)]] make use of the natural [[pixel]]s of the weave, lending themselves to geometric designs.<ref>Snook, Barbara. ''Florentine Embroidery''. Scribner, Second edition 1967.</ref><ref>Williams, Elsa S. ''Bargello: Florentine Canvas Work''. Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1967.</ref>

==Weaving==

[[Ada Dietz]] (1882 &ndash; 1950) was an American [[weaving|weaver]] best known for her 1949 monograph ''Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles'', which defines weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate [[polynomial]]s.<ref>{{citation | last = Dietz | first = Ada K. | location = Louisville, Kentucky

==Spinning==

[[Margaret Greig]] was a mathematician who articulated the mathematics of [[worsted spinning]].<ref>{{citation |title=International Women in Science |author=Catharine M. C. Haines |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2001 |isbn=9781576070901 |page=118}}</ref>

==Fashion design==

The silk scarves from DMCK Designs' 2013 collection<ref>[http://www.dmck.us DMCK Designs]</ref> are all based on [[space-filling curve]] patterns that Doug McKenna has devised or discovered.  The designs are either generalized Peano curves, or based on a new space-filling construction technique.  Both techniques are described in short papers available in the Bridges Math and Art conference proceedings (2007 and 2008).<ref>[http://www.bridgesmathart.org Bridges Math and Art]{{better ref needed}}</ref>

The [[Issey Miyake]] Fall-Winter 2010–2011 ready-to-wear collection featured designs from a collaboration between fashion designer Dai Fujiwara and mathematician [[William Thurston]]. The designs were inspired by Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]], the statement that every [[3-manifold]] can be decomposed into pieces with one of eight different uniform geometries, a proof of which had been sketched in 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]] as part of his proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]].<ref>{{cite | last = Barchfield | first = Jenny | date = March 5, 2010 | publisher = [[ABC News]] | title = Fashion and Advanced Mathematics Meet at Miyake | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10017982}}.</ref>
