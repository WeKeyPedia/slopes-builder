[[File:Meander alagrek.svg|thumb|Examples of frieze group patterns]]
A '''frieze group''' is a mathematical concept to classify designs on [[two-dimensional]] surfaces which are repetitive in one direction, based on the [[symmetry|symmetries]] in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in [[architecture]] and [[decorative art]]. The mathematical study of such patterns reveals that exactly 7 different types of patterns can occur.

Frieze groups are two-dimensional [[line group]]s, from having only one direction of repeat, and they are related to the more complex [[wallpaper group]]s, which classify patterns that are repetitive in two directions.

As with wallpaper groups, a frieze group is often visualised by a simple periodic pattern in the category concerned.

==General==
Formally, a frieze group is a class of infinite discrete [[symmetry group]]s for patterns on a strip (infinitely wide rectangle), hence a class of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the plane, or of a strip.  There are seven different frieze groups. The actual symmetry groups within a frieze group are characterized by the smallest translation distance, and, for the frieze groups 4–7, by a shifting parameter. In the case of symmetry groups in the plane, additional parameters are the direction of the translation vector, and,  for the frieze groups 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, the positioning perpendicular to the translation vector. Thus there are two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] for group 1, three for groups 2, 3, and 4, and four for groups 5, 6, and 7.  Many authors present the frieze groups in a different order.<ref>{{cite book

A symmetry group of a frieze group necessarily contains [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s and may contain [[glide reflection]]s.  Other possible group elements are [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s along the long axis of the strip, reflections along the narrow axis of the strip and 180° [[rotation]]s.  For two of the seven frieze groups (numbers 1 and 2 below) the symmetry groups are [[Generating set of a group|singly generated]], for four (numbers 3–6) they have a pair of generators, and for number 7 the symmetry groups require three generators.

A symmetry group in frieze group 1, 3, 4, or 5 is a [[subgroup]] of a symmetry group in the last frieze group with the same translational distance. A symmetry group in frieze group 2 or 6  is a subgroup of a symmetry group in the last frieze group with ''half'' the translational distance. This last frieze group contains the symmetry groups of the simplest periodic patterns in the strip (or the plane), a row of dots.  Any transformation of the plane leaving this pattern invariant can be decomposed into a translation, (''x'',''y'') → (''n''+''x'',''y''), optionally followed by a reflection in either the horizontal axis, (''x'',''y'') → (''x'',−''y''), or the vertical axis, (''x'',''y'') → (−''x'',''y''), provided that this axis is chosen through or midway between two dots, or a rotation by 180°, (''x'',''y'') → (−''x'',−''y'') (ditto).  Therefore, in a way, this frieze group contains the "largest" symmetry groups, which consist of all such transformations.

The inclusion of the ''discrete'' condition is to exclude the group containing all translations, and groups containing arbitrarily small translations (e.g. the group of horizontal translations by rational distances). Even apart from scaling and shifting, there are infinitely many cases, e.g. by considering rational numbers of which the denominators are powers of a given prime number.

The inclusion of the ''infinite'' condition is to exclude groups that have no translations:
*the group with the identity only (isomorphic to ''C''<sub>1</sub>, the [[trivial group]] of order 1).
*the group consisting of the identity and reflection in the horizontal axis (isomorphic to ''C''<sub>2</sub>, the [[cyclic group]] of order 2).
*the groups each consisting of the identity and reflection in a vertical axis (ditto)
*the groups each consisting of the identity and 180° rotation about a point on the horizontal axis (ditto)
*the groups each consisting of the identity, reflection in a vertical axis, reflection in the horizontal axis, and 180° rotation about the point of intersection (isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]])

==Descriptions of the seven frieze groups==
There are seven distinct subgroups (up to scaling and shifting of patterns) in the discrete frieze group generated by a translation, reflection (along the same axis) and a 180° rotation. Each of these subgroups is the symmetry group of a frieze pattern, and sample patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The seven different groups correspond to [[Point groups in three dimensions#The seven infinite series of axial groups|the 7 infinite series of axial point groups in three dimensions]], with ''n'' = ∞.<ref>{{citation | first1=G.L. | last1=Fisher | first2=B. | last2=Mellor | title= Three-dimensional finite point groups and the symmetry of beaded beads | journal=Journal for Mathematics and the Arts | year=2007 | url=http://myweb.lmu.edu/bmellor/beadedbeads.pdf}}</ref> They are identified using [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]] or [[IUC notation]],<ref>{{citation | first=Paolo G., | last=Radaelli | title=Fundamentals of Crystallographic Symmetry | url= http://radaelli.physics.ox.ac.uk/documents/more_advanced.pdf}}</ref> [[orbifold notation]], [[Coxeter notation]], and [[Schönflies notation]]:

Summarized:
#p1: T ([[translation (geometry)|translation]] only, in the horizontal direction)
#p1m1: TV (translation and vertical line reflection)
#p11m: TH (translation and horizontal [[Reflection (mathematics)|line reflection]])
#p11g: TG (translation and [[glide reflection]])
#p2: TR (translation and 180° [[rotation]])
#p2mg: TRVG (translation, 180° rotation, vertical line reflection, and glide reflection)
#p2mm: TRHVG (translation, 180° rotation, horizontal line reflection, vertical line reflection, and glide reflection)

As we have seen, up to [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]], there are four groups, two [[Abelian group|abelian]], and two non-abelian.

The groups can be classified by their type of two-dimensional grid or lattice:<ref>{{Citation | last1=Hitzer | first1=E.S.M. | last2=Ichikawa | first2=D. | title=Representation of crystallographic subperiodic groups by geometric algebra | url=http://sinai.apphy.u-fukui.ac.jp/gcj/publications/RCSGGA/RCSGGA.pdf | journal=Electronic Proc. of AGACSE | issue=3, 17–19 Aug. 2008 | location=Leipzig, Germany | year=2008}}</ref>

The lattice being oblique means that the second direction need not be orthogonal to the direction of repeat.

==Web demo and software==

There exist software graphic tools that create 2D patterns using frieze groups. Usually, the entire pattern is updated automatically in response to edits of the original strip.
