[[File:Locus Curve.svg|thumb|right|400px|Each curve in this example is a ''locus'' defined as the [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoid]] of a circle centered at point ''P'' and the line ''l''. In this example, ''P'' is 7cm from ''l''.]]

In [[geometry]], a '''locus''' (plural: ''loci'') is a set of points whose location satisfies or is determined by one or more specified conditions.<ref name=James>{{citation|first1=Robert Clarke|last1=James|first2=Glenn|last2=James|title=Mathematics Dictionary|publisher=Springer|year=1992|isbn=978-0-412-99041-0|page=255|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UyIfgBIwLMQC&pg=PA255}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Alfred North|last=Whitehead|authorlink=Alfred North Whitehead|title=An Introduction to Mathematics|publisher=H.

==Commonly studied loci==
Examples from plane geometry include:
* The set of points equidistant from two points is a [[perpendicular bisector]] to the [[line segment]] connecting the two points.<ref>George E. Martin, ''The Foundations of Geometry and the Non-Euclidean Plane'', Springer-Verlag, 1975</ref>
* The set of points equidistant from two lines which cross is the [[angle bisector]].
* All [[conic section]]s are loci:<ref>{{citation|first1=Henry Parr|last1=Hamilton|title=An Analytical System of Conic Sections: Designed for the Use of Students|publisher=Springer|year=834}}</ref>
** [[Parabola]]: the set of points equidistant from a single point (the [[focus (geometry)|focus]]) and a line (the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]).
** [[Circle]]: the set of points for which the distance from a single point is constant (the [[radius]]). The set of points for each of which the ratio of the distances to two given foci is a positive constant (that is not 1)  is referred to as a [[Circles of Apollonius|Circle of Apollonius]].
**[[Hyperbola]]: the set of points for each of which the absolute value of the difference between the distances to two given foci is a constant.
**[[Ellipse]]: the set of points for each of which the sum of the distances to two given foci is a constant. The [[circle]] is the special case in which the two foci coincide with each other.

==Proof of a locus==
In order to prove that a geometric shape is the correct locus for a given set of conditions, one generally divides the proof into two stages:<ref>G.P. West''The new geometry: form 1''</ref>
* Proof that all the points that satisfy the conditions are on the given shape.
* Proof that all the points on the given shape satisfy the conditions.

== Examples ==
[[File:Locus apollonius.svg|thumb|(distance ''PA'') = 3.(distance ''PB'')]]

===First example===
We find the locus of the points ''P'' that have a given ratio of distances ''k'' = ''d''<sub>1</sub>/''d''<sub>2</sub> to two given points.<br>
In this example we choose ''k''= 3, ''A''(-1,0) and ''B''(0,2) as the fixed points.

:: ''P''(''x,y'') is a point of the locus
: <math>\Leftrightarrow |PA| = 3 |PB| </math>
: <math> \Leftrightarrow |PA|^2 = 9 |PB|^2 </math>
:<math>\Leftrightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-0)^2=9(x-0)^2+9(y-2)^2 </math>
: <math> \Leftrightarrow 8(x^2+y^2)-2x-36y+35 =0 </math>
:<math>\Leftrightarrow \left(x-\frac18\right)^2+\left(y-\frac94\right)^2=\frac{45}{64}</math>

This equation represents a [[circle]] with center (1/8,9/4) and radius <math> \frac{3}{8}\sqrt{5}</math>. It is the [[circle of Apollonius#Apollonius' definition of a circle|circle of Apollonius]] defined by these values of ''k'', ''A'', and ''B''.

===Second example===

[[File:Locus3a.svg|thumb|Locus of point C]]
A triangle ''ABC'' has a fixed side [''AB''] with length ''c''. 
We determine the locus of the third [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] ''C'' such that
the [[Median (geometry)|medians]] from ''A'' and ''C'' are [[orthogonal]].

We choose an [[orthonormal]] [[coordinate system]] such that ''A''(-''c''/2,0), ''B''(''c''/2,0). 
''C''(''x,y'') is the variable third vertex. The center of [''BC''] is ''M''( (2''x+c'')/4, ''y''/2 ). The median from ''C'' has a slope  ''y''/''x''. The median ''AM'' has [[slope]]  2''y''/(2''x''+3''c'').

[[File:Locus3.svg|thumb|The locus is a circle]]
::''C''(''x,y'') is a point of the locus
:<math>\Leftrightarrow</math>    The medians from ''A'' and ''C'' are orthogonal
:<math>\Leftrightarrow  \frac{y}{x} \cdot \frac{2y}{2x+3c} = -1 </math>  
:<math>\Leftrightarrow       2 y^2 + 2x^2 + 3c x = 0 </math>  
:<math>\Leftrightarrow       x^2 + y^2 + (3c/2) x = 0 </math>  
:<math>\Leftrightarrow       (x +  3c/4)^2 + y^2 = 9c^2/16 </math>

The locus of the vertex ''C'' is a circle   with center (-3''c''/4,0) and radius 3''c''/4.

===Third example===
[[File:Geassocieerde rechten.svg|thumb|The intersection point of the associated lines ''k'' and ''l'' describes the circle]]
A locus can also be defined by two associated curves depending on one common [[parameter]]. If the parameter varies, the intersection points of the associated curves describe the locus.

In the figure, the points ''K'' and ''L'' are fixed points on a given line ''m''. The line ''k'' is a variable line through ''K''. The line ''l'' through ''L'' is [[perpendicular]] to ''k''. The angle <math>\alpha</math> between ''k'' and ''m'' is the parameter.
''k'' and  ''l'' are  associated lines depending on the common parameter. The variable intersection point ''S'' of ''k'' and ''l'' describes a circle. This circle is the locus of the intersection point of the two associated lines.

===Fourth example===

A locus of points need not be one-dimensional (as a circle, line, etc.). For example,<ref name=James/> the locus of the inequality 2''x''+3''y''–6<0 is the portion of the plane that is below the line 2''x''+3''y''–6=0.
