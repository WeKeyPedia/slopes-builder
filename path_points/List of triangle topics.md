This list of [[triangle]] topics includes things related to the geometric shape, either abstractly, as in idealizations studied by geometers, or in triangular arrays such as [[Pascal's triangle]] or [[triangular matrix|triangular matrices]], or concretely in physical space. It does not include metaphors like "love triangle" in which the word has no reference to the geometric shape.
