In [[geometry]], a '''tetrahedron''' (plural: '''tetrahedra''' or '''tetrahedrons''') is a [[polyhedron]] composed of four [[triangular]] [[Face (geometry)|faces]], three of which meet at each corner or [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. It has six [[Edge (geometry)|edges]] and four vertices. The tetrahedron is the simplest of all the ordinary [[convex polytope|convex polyhedra]] and the only  one that has fewer than 5 faces.<ref name="MW">{{MathWorld |urlname=Tetrahedron |title=Tetrahedron }}</ref>

The tetrahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] [[simplex]].

The tetrahedron is one kind of [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], which is a polyhedron with a flat [[polygon]] base and triangular faces connecting the base to a common point. In the case of a tetrahedron the base is a triangle (any of the four faces can be considered the base), so a tetrahedron is also known as a "triangular pyramid".

Like all [[convex polyhedra]], a tetrahedron can be folded from a single sheet of paper. It has two such [[net (polyhedron)|nets]].<ref name="MW" />

For any tetrahedron there exists a sphere (called the [[circumsphere]]) on which all four vertices lie, and another sphere (the [[insphere]]) [[tangent]] to the tetrahedron's faces.

==Regular tetrahedron==
A '''regular tetrahedron''' is one in which all four faces are [[equilateral triangle]]s. It is one of the five regular [[Platonic solid]]s, which have been known since antiquity.

In a regular tetrahedron, not only are all its faces the same size and shape (congruent) but so are all its vertices and edges.

[[File:Tetrahedrons cannot fill space..PNG|thumb|300px|Five tetrahedra are laid flat on a plane, with the highest 3-dimensional points marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These points are then attached to each other and a thin volume of empty space is left, where the five edge angles do not quite meet.]]
Regular tetrahedra alone do not [[Tessellation#Tessellations in higher dimensions|tessellate]] (fill space), but if alternated with [[regular octahedron|regular octahedra]] they form the [[alternated cubic honeycomb]], which is a tessellation.

The regular tetrahedron is self-dual, which means that its [[Dual polyhedron|dual]] is another regular tetrahedron. The [[Polyhedral compound|compound]] figure comprising two such dual tetrahedra form a [[stellated octahedron]] or stella octangula.

===Formulas for a regular tetrahedron===<!--[[Tetrahedral angle]] redirects here-->
The following Cartesian coordinates define the four vertices of a tetrahedron with edge length 2, centered at the origin:
:(±1, 0, −1/√2)
:(0, ±1, 1/√2)

Another set of coordinates are based on an [[Alternation (geometry)|alternated]] [[cube]] with edge length 2. The tetrahedron in this case has edge length <math>2\sqrt{2}</math>. Inverting these coordinates generates the dual tetrahedron, and the pair together form the stellated octahedron, whose vertices are those of the original cube.
:Tetrahedon: (1,1,1), (1,−1,−1), (−1,1,−1), (−1,−1,1)
:Dual tetrahedron: (−1,−1,−1), (−1,1,1), (1,−1,1), (1,1,−1)

Note that with respect to the base plane the [[slope]] of a face (<math>\scriptstyle 2 \sqrt{2}</math>) is twice that of an edge (<math>\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}</math>), corresponding to the fact that the ''horizontal'' distance covered from the base to the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] along an edge is twice that along the [[Median (geometry)|median]] of a face. In other words, if ''C'' is the [[centroid]] of the base, the distance from ''C'' to a vertex of the base is twice that from ''C'' to the midpoint of an edge of the base. This follows from the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at its centroid, and this point divides each of them in two segments, one of which is twice as long as the other (see [[centroid#Proof that the centroid of a triangle divides each median in the ratio 2:1|proof]]).

===Isometries of the regular tetrahedron===
[[Image:Symmetries of the tetrahedron.svg|thumb|400px|The proper rotations, (order-3 rotation on a vertex and face, and order-2 on 2 edges) and reflection plane (through 2 faces and one edge) in the symmetry group of the regular tetrahedron]]
The vertices of a [[cube]] can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular tetrahedron (see above, and also [[:Image:Tetraeder animation with cube.gif|animation]], showing one of the two tetrahedra in the cube). The [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] of a regular tetrahedron correspond to half of those of a cube: those that map the tetrahedra to themselves, and not to each other.

The tetrahedron is the only Platonic solid that is not mapped to itself by [[point inversion]].

The regular tetrahedron has 24 isometries, forming the [[symmetry group]] '''T<sub>d</sub>''', [3,3], (*332), isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]], ''S''<sub>4</sub>. They can be categorized as follows:
* '''T''', [3,3]<sup>+</sup>, (332) is isomorphic to [[alternating group]], ''A''<sub>4</sub> (the identity and 11 proper rotations) with the following [[conjugacy class]]es (in parentheses are given the permutations of the vertices, or correspondingly, the faces, and the [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|unit quaternion representation]]):
** identity (identity; 1)
** rotation about an axis through a vertex, perpendicular to the opposite plane, by an angle of ±120°: 4 axes, 2 per axis, together {{nowrap|8 ((1 2 3)}}, etc.; {{nowrap|(1 ± ''i'' ± ''j'' ± ''k'') / 2)}}
** rotation by an angle of 180° such that an edge maps to the opposite edge: {{nowrap|3 ((1 2)(3 4)}}, etc.; {{nowrap|''i'', ''j'', ''k''}})
* reflections in a plane perpendicular to an edge: 6
* reflections in a plane combined with 90° rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane: 3 axes, 2 per axis, together 6; equivalently, they are 90° rotations combined with inversion ('''x''' is mapped to −'''x'''): the rotations correspond to those of the cube about face-to-face axes

===Orthogonal projections of the regular tetrahedron===
The regular ''tetrahedron'' has two special [[orthogonal projection]]s, one centered on a vertex or equivalently on a face, and one centered on an edge. The first corresponds to the A<sub>2</sub> [[Coxeter plane]].

===Spherical tiling===
The tetrahedron also be represented as a [[spherical tiling]], and projected onto the plane via a [[stereographic projection]]. This projection is [[Conformal map|conformal]], preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.

An '''isosceles tetrahedron''', also called a [[disphenoid]], is a tetrahedron where all four faces are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] triangles.  A '''space-filling tetrahedron''' packs with congruent copies of itself to tile space, like the [[disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb]].

In a [[trirectangular tetrahedron]] the three face angles at one vertex are [[right angle]]s. If all three pairs of opposite edges of a tetrahedron are [[perpendicular]], then it is called an [[orthocentric tetrahedron]]. When only one pair of opposite edges are perpendicular, it is called a '''semi-orthocentric tetrahedron'''. An '''isodynamic tetrahedron''' is one in which the [[cevian]]s that join the vertices to the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incenters]] of the opposite faces are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]], and an '''isogonic tetrahedron''' has concurrent cevians that join the vertices to the points of contact of the opposite faces with the [[inscribed sphere]] of the tetrahedron.

===Isometries of irregular tetrahedra===
The isometries of an irregular (unmarked) tetrahedron depend on the geometry of the tetrahedron, with 7 cases possible. In each case a [[Point groups in three dimensions|3-dimensional point group]] is formed. Two other isometries (C<sub>3</sub>, [3]<sup>+</sup>), and (S<sub>4</sub>, [2<sup>+</sup>,4<sup>+</sup>]) can exist if the face or edge marking are included. Tetrahedral diagrams are included for each type below, with edges colored by isometric equivalence, and are gray colored for unique edges.

==General properties==

===Volume===
The volume of a tetrahedron is given by the pyramid volume formula:
:<math>V = \frac{1}{3} A_0\,h \,</math>

where ''A''<sub>0</sub> is the area of the [[base (geometry)|base]] and ''h'' the height from the base to the apex. This applies for each of the four choices of the base, so the distances from the apexes to the opposite faces are inversely proportional to the areas of these faces.

For a tetrahedron with vertices
{{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''a''<sub>3</sub>)}},
{{nowrap|'''b''' {{=}} (''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ''b''<sub>3</sub>)}},
{{nowrap|'''c''' {{=}} (''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>3</sub>)}}, and
{{nowrap|'''d''' {{=}} (''d''<sub>1</sub>, ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>3</sub>)}}, the volume is {{nowrap|(1/6)·{{!}}[[determinant|det]]('''a''' − '''d''', '''b''' − '''d''', '''c''' − '''d'''){{!}}}}, or any other combination of pairs of vertices that form a simply connected [[graph theory|graph]]. This can be rewritten using a [[dot product]] and a [[cross product]], yielding
:<math>V = \frac { |(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{d}) \cdot ((\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{d}) \times (\mathbf{c}-\mathbf{d}))| } {6}.</math>

If the origin of the coordinate system is chosen to coincide with vertex '''d''', then '''d''' = 0, so
:<math>V = \frac { |\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})| } {6},</math>

where '''a''', '''b''', and '''c''' represent three edges that meet at one vertex, and {{nowrap|'''a''' · ('''b''' × '''c''')}} is a [[scalar triple product]]. Comparing this formula with that used to compute the volume of a [[parallelepiped]], we conclude that the volume of a tetrahedron is equal to 1/6 of the volume of any parallelepiped that shares three converging edges with it.

The triple scalar can be represented by the following determinants:
:<math>6 \cdot V =\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{a} & \mathbf{b} & \mathbf{c}
\end{vmatrix}</math>{{pad|2em}}or{{pad|1em}}<math>6 \cdot V =\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{a} \\ \mathbf{b} \\ \mathbf{c}
\end{vmatrix}</math>{{pad|2em}}where{{pad|1em}}<math>\mathbf{a} = (a_1,a_2,a_3) \,</math>{{pad|1em}}is expressed as a row or column vector etc.

Hence
:<math>36 \cdot V^2 =\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{a^2} & \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} & \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} \\
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} & \mathbf{b^2} & \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} \\
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} & \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} & \mathbf{c^2}
\end{vmatrix}</math>{{pad|1em}}where{{pad|1em}}<math>\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = ab\cos{\gamma}</math>{{pad|1em}}etc.

which gives
:<math>V = \frac {abc} {6} \sqrt{1 + 2\cos{\alpha}\cos{\beta}\cos{\gamma}-\cos^2{\alpha}-\cos^2{\beta}-\cos^2{\gamma}}, \,</math>
where ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'' are the plane angles occurring in vertex '''d'''. The angle ''α'', is the angle between the two edges connecting the vertex '''d''' to the vertices '''b''' and '''c'''. The angle ''β'', does so for the vertices '''a''' and '''c''', while ''γ'', is defined by the position of the vertices '''a''' and '''b'''.

Given the distances between the vertices of a tetrahedron the volume can be computed using the [[Cayley–Menger determinant]]:
:<math>288 \cdot V^2 =
\begin{vmatrix}
  0 & 1        & 1        & 1        & 1        \\
  1 & 0        & d_{12}^2 & d_{13}^2 & d_{14}^2 \\
  1 & d_{12}^2 & 0        & d_{23}^2 & d_{24}^2 \\
  1 & d_{13}^2 & d_{23}^2 & 0        & d_{34}^2 \\
  1 & d_{14}^2 & d_{24}^2 & d_{34}^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}</math>
where the subscripts <math>i,\,j\in\{1,\,2,\,3,\,4\}</math> represent the vertices {'''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''d'''} and <math>\scriptstyle d_{ij}</math> is the pairwise distance between them – i.e., the length of the edge connecting the two vertices. A negative value of the determinant means that a tetrahedron cannot be constructed with the given distances. This formula, sometimes called [[Tartaglia's formula]], is essentially due to the painter [[Piero della Francesca]] in the 15th century, as a three dimensional analogue of the 1st century [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle.<ref>[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath664/kmath664.htm "Simplex Volumes and the Cayley-Menger Determinant"], MathPages.com</ref>

\end{align}
</math>

====Volume divider====

A plane that divides two opposite edges of a tetrahedron in a given ratio also divides the volume of the tetrahedron in the same ratio. Thus any plane containing a bimedian (connector of opposite edges' midpoints) of a tetrahedron [[bisection|bisects]] the volume of the tetrahedron<ref>Weisstein, Eric W. "Tetrahedron." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tetrahedron.html</ref><ref>Altshiller-Court, N. "The tetrahedron." Ch. 4 in ''Modern Pure Solid Geometry'': Chelsea, 1979.</ref>{{rp|pp.89–90}}

====Non-Euclidean volume====
For tetrahedra in [[hyperbolic space]] or in three-dimensional [[spherical geometry]], the [[dihedral angle]]s of the tetrahedron determine its shape and hence its volume. In these cases, the volume is given by the [[Murakami–Yano formula]].<ref>{{Citation | last1=Murakami | first1=Jun | last2=Yano | first2=Masakazu | title=On the volume of a hyperbolic and spherical tetrahedron | url= http://intlpress.com/CAG/CAG-v13.php#v13n2|mr=2154824 | year=2005 | journal=Communications in Analysis and Geometry | issn=1019-8385 | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=379–400}}
</ref> However, in Euclidean space, scaling a tetrahedron changes its volume but not its dihedral angles, so no such formula can exist.

===Distance between the edges===
Any two opposite edges of a tetrahedron lie on two [[skew lines]], and the distance between the edges is defined as the distance between the two skew lines. Let ''d'' be the distance between the skew lines formed by opposite edges '''a''' and {{nowrap|'''b''' − '''c'''}} as calculated [[Skew lines#Distance between two skew lines|here]]. Then another volume formula is given by
:<math>V = \frac {d |(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{(b-c)})| } {6}.</math>

===Properties analogous to those of a triangle===
The tetrahedron has many properties analogous to those of a triangle, including an insphere, circumsphere, medial tetrahedron, and exspheres. It has respective centers such as incenter, circumcenter, excenters, [[Spieker circle|Spieker center]] and points such as a centroid. However, there is generally no orthocenter in the sense of intersecting altitudes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Havlicek |first=Hans |last2=Weiß |first2=Gunter |title=Altitudes of a tetrahedron and traceless quadratic forms |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=110 |issue=8 |pages=679–693 |year=2003 |url=http://www.geometrie.tuwien.ac.at/havlicek/pub/hoehen.pdf |doi=10.2307/3647851 |jstor=3647851 }}</ref>

[[Gaspard Monge]] found a center that exists in every tetrahedron, now known as the ''Monge point'': the point where the six midplanes of a tetrahedron intersect. A midplane is defined as a plane that is orthogonal to an edge joining any two vertices that also contains the centroid of an opposite edge formed by joining the other two vertices. If the tetrahedron's altitudes do intersect, then the Monge point and the orthocenter coincide to give the class of [[orthocentric tetrahedron]].

An orthogonal line dropped from the Monge point to any face meets that face at the midpoint of the line segment between that face's orthocenter and the foot of the altitude dropped from the opposite vertex.

A line segment joining a vertex of a tetrahedron with the [[centroid]] of the opposite face is called a ''median'' and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a ''bimedian'' of the tetrahedron. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians in a tetrahedron. These seven line segments are all [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] at a point called the ''centroid'' of the tetrahedron.<ref>Leung, Kam-tim; and Suen, Suk-nam; "Vectors, matrices and geometry", Hong Kong University Press, 1994, pp. 53–54</ref> The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter. These points define the ''Euler line'' of the tetrahedron that is analogous to the [[Euler line]] of a triangle.

The [[nine-point circle]] of the general triangle has an analogue in the circumsphere of a tetrahedron's medial tetrahedron. It is the ''twelve-point sphere'' and besides the centroids of the four faces of the reference tetrahedron, it passes through four substitute ''Euler points'', 1/3 of the way from the Monge point toward each of the four vertices. Finally it passes through the four base points of orthogonal lines dropped from each Euler point to the face not containing the vertex that generated the Euler point.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Outudee |first=Somluck |last2=New |first2=Stephen |title=The Various Kinds of Centres of Simplices |publisher=Dept of Mathematics, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090227143222/http://www.math.sc.chula.ac.th/ICAA2002/pages/Somluck_Outudee.pdf }}</ref>

The center ''T'' of the twelve-point sphere also lies on the Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, this center lies 1/3 of the way from the Monge point ''M'' towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through ''T'' to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.

The radius of the twelve-point sphere is 1/3 of the circumradius of the reference tetrahedron.

where <math> \alpha_{ij}</math> is the angle between the faces ''i'' and ''j''.

===Geometric relations===
A tetrahedron is a 3-[[simplex]]. Unlike the case of the other Platonic solids, all the vertices of a regular tetrahedron are equidistant from each other (they are the only possible arrangement of four equidistant points in 3-dimensional space).

A tetrahedron is a triangular [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], and the regular tetrahedron is [[self-dual polyhedron|self-dual]].

A regular tetrahedron can be embedded inside a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] in two ways such that each vertex is a vertex of the cube, and each edge is a diagonal of one of the cube's faces. For one such embedding, the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are
:(+1, +1, +1);
:(−1, −1, +1);
:(−1, +1, −1);
:(+1, −1, −1).

This yields a tetrahedron with edge-length <math>\scriptstyle 2 \sqrt{2}</math>, centered at the origin. For the other tetrahedron (which is [[dual polyhedron|dual]] to the first), reverse all the signs. These two tetrahedra's vertices combined are the vertices of a cube, demonstrating that the regular tetrahedron is the 3-[[demicube]].

[[File:Compound of two tetrahedra.png|thumb|200px|The [[stella octangula]].]]
The volume of this tetrahedron is 1/3 the volume of the cube. Combining both tetrahedra gives a regular [[polyhedral compound]] called the [[compound of two tetrahedra]] or [[stella octangula]].

The interior of the stella octangula is an [[octahedron]], and correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off, from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. [[Rectification (geometry)|rectifying]] the tetrahedron).

The above embedding divides the cube into five tetrahedra, one of which is regular. In fact, 5 is the minimum number of tetrahedra required to compose a cube.

Inscribing tetrahedra inside the regular [[Polyhedral compound|compound of five cubes]] gives two more regular compounds, containing five and ten tetrahedra.

Regular tetrahedra cannot [[Honeycomb (geometry)|tessellate space]] by themselves, although this result seems likely enough that [[Aristotle]] claimed it was possible. However, two regular tetrahedra can be combined with an octahedron, giving a [[rhombohedron]] that can tile space.

However, several irregular tetrahedra are known, of which copies can tile space, for instance the [[disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb]]. The complete list remains an open problem.<ref>{{Cite journal

If one relaxes the requirement that the tetrahedra be all the same shape, one can tile space using only tetrahedra in many different ways. For example, one can divide an octahedron into four identical tetrahedra and combine them again with two regular ones. (As a side-note: these two kinds of tetrahedron have the same volume.)

The tetrahedron is unique among the [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]] in possessing no parallel faces.

===A law of sines for tetrahedra and the space of all shapes of tetrahedra===
[[Image:tetra.png|248px]]

A corollary of the usual [[law of sines]] is that in a tetrahedron with vertices ''O'', ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', we have
:<math>\sin\angle OAB\cdot\sin\angle OBC\cdot\sin\angle OCA = \sin\angle OAC\cdot\sin\angle OCB\cdot\sin\angle OBA.\,</math>

One may view the two sides of this identity as corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise orientations of the surface.

Putting any of the four vertices in the role of ''O'' yields four such identities, but at most three of them are independent: If the "clockwise" sides of three of them are multiplied and the product is inferred to be equal to the product of the "counterclockwise" sides of the same three identities, and then common factors are cancelled from both sides, the result is the fourth identity.

Three angles are the angles of some triangle if and only if their sum is 180° (π radians). What condition on 12 angles is necessary and sufficient for them to be the 12 angles of some tetrahedron? Clearly the sum of the angles of any side of the tetrahedron must be 180°. Since there are four such triangles, there are four such constraints on sums of angles, and the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] is thereby reduced from 12 to 8. The four relations given by this sine law further reduce the number of degrees of freedom, from 8 down to not 4 but 5, since the fourth constraint is not independent of the first three. Thus the space of all shapes of tetrahedra is 5-dimensional.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Is There a "Most Chiral Tetrahedron"? |first1=André |last1=Rassat |first2=Patrick W. |last2=Fowler |journal=Chemistry: A European Journal |volume=10 |issue=24 |pages=6575–6580 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/chem.200400869 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Applications==

===Numerical analysis===
[[File:Malla irregular de triángulos modelizando una superficie convexa.png|thumb|An irregular volume in space can be approximated by an irregular triangulated surface, and irregular tetrahedral volume elements.]]
In [[numerical analysis]], complicated three-dimensional shapes are commonly broken down into, or [[approximate]]d by, a [[polygon mesh|polygonal mesh]] of irregular [[tetrahedra]] in the process of setting up the equations for [[finite element analysis]] especially in the [[numerical solution]] of [[partial differential equations]]. These methods have wide applications in practical applications in [[computational fluid dynamics]], [[aerodynamics]], [[electromagnetic field]]s, [[civil engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[naval architecture|naval architecture and engineering]], and related fields.

===Chemistry===
[[Image:Ammonium-3D-balls.png|100px|thumb|The [[ammonium]]+ ion is tetrahedral]]
{{main|Tetrahedral molecular geometry}}
The tetrahedron shape is seen in nature in [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] molecules. All sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized atoms are surrounded by atoms (or [[lone pair|lone electron pairs]]) at the four corners of a tetrahedron. For instance in a [[methane]] molecule (CH<sub>4</sub>) or an [[ammonium]] ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), four hydrogen atoms surround a central carbon or nitrogen atom with tetrahedral symmetry. For this reason, one of the leading journals in organic chemistry is called ''[[Tetrahedron (journal)|Tetrahedron]]''. The [[central angle]] between any two vertices of a perfect tetrahedron is <math>\arccos{\left(-\tfrac{1}{3}\right)}</math>, or approximately 109.47°.

[[Water]], H<sub>2</sub>O, also has a tetrahedral structure, with two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electrons around the central oxygen atoms. Its tetrahedral symmetry is not perfect, however, because the lone pairs repel more than the single O-H bonds.

Quaternary phase diagrams in chemistry are represented graphically as tetrahedra.

However, quaternary phase diagrams in [[communication engineering]] are represented graphically on a two-dimensional plane.

Since [[silicon]] is the most common [[semiconductor]] used in [[solid-state electronics]], and silicon has a [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] of four, the tetrahedral shape of the four chemical bonds in silicon is a strong influence on how [[crystal]]s of silicon form and what shapes they assume.
